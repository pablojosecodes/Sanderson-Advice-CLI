{"0": [["0", "BRANDON: Let\u2019s talk about my philosophy\u00a0\non teaching writing. All right?\u00a0So here\u2019s the thing. I can\u2019t teach you how to be a\u00a0\nwriter. I just can\u2019t. Writing is a skill that you\u00a0\u00a0have to practice on your own. And I can generally\u00a0\ngive you some nudges, some tips, some hints, and\u00a0\u00a0some tools. And that is my focus in this class.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a focus on giving you as many tools as you\u00a0\u00a0can possibly hold, as many as I can give you, so\u00a0\nthat when you are doing your own writing you have\u00a0\u00a0them in hand and can try different things out.\nThe longer I\u2019ve been a professional novelist,\u00a0\u00a0the more I\u2019ve realized that these sorts of tools\u00a0\nare really handy for troubleshooting, even for me\u00a0\u00a0in my career right now. If I have a problem in\u00a0\na book, I go back to these sorts of fundamentals\u00a0\u00a0that I talk about in the class. And I try to say,\u00a0\nOK, people are having this reaction to my book. My\u00a0\u00a0editor and my alpha readers are feeling lost at\u00a0\nthis point. What\u2019s the problem? Can I diagnose\u00a0\u00a0it using these kind of basic structural tools\u00a0\nthat we\u2019ll talk about in the plotting lectures?\u00a0These are not things that I do often anymore when\u00a0\nI\u2019m sitting down and actually writing. They\u2019re\u00a0\u00a0kind of in the back of my head. I use them a lot\u00a0\nin outlining, and I use them a lot in diagnosing.\u00a0\u00a0Early in my career, these sorts of tools were\u00a0\nreally handy to just try a tool out to see how\u00a0\u00a0it worked for me. And I\u2019ll explain what I mean\u00a0\nby tools a little bit later in this lecture.\u00a0But for right now, the main thing I want\u00a0\nyou to take away is, you will probably\u00a0\u00a0get almost nothing from this class unless\u00a0\nyou are currently working on your writing."]], "1": {"0": " Welcome to class, guys. This is Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy\n2020 Brandon Sanderson lectures. Thank you, guys, for coming. You do not need to clap. Let me start this class by giving you a little\nhistory of why this class exists. Way back when in the '80s, Orson Scott Card\nwas going to teach a creative writing class on campus. Everyone was really excited about it. A bunch of people signed up for it. Then for various reasons he was unable to\nteach the class. So a professor at BYU, who was a literature\nprofessor who liked science fiction, started teaching a class on how to write science fiction\nand fantasy so that those people who had signed up would still have a class. It was popular. People kept taking it. It was very exciting for them to have a class\nabout sci fi/fantasy.", "51": " This class started in, like, '85 or something,\nand kept going. I was a student at BYU from '94 to 2000, and\nI didn't end up taking the class until 2000. For various reasons it didn't fit my schedule. In 2000, David Wolverton, also known as Dave\nFarland under his pen name, started teaching the class. Doc Smith, who had been the professor who\nwas teaching it, he had medical issues and stepped down from it, and they wanted to get\na professional writer to teach it. When I heard that there was an actual professional\nwriter teaching a class, I was really excited. Like, the idea of being able to go and listen\nto a pro in the field was really interesting to me. I didn't know the half of it. That class was the single most valuable class\nI took my entire career at BYU. This is because, while my other professors\nwere really good about talking about things like theme, and finding your inner writing\nsoul, and all this sort of stuff, they couldn't really talk about how to build a compelling\ncharacter. They couldn't talk about, here is how you\ntake a plot structure and you adapt it to your own story in a way that is interesting,\ncompelling, and original. They certainly couldn't talk about what to\ndo when someone actually offers you a contract. None of this stuff could I get from most of\nthe professors. Now, there are occasionally other professors\nthat teach who have experience.", "144": " I just hadn't been able to take their classes\nyet. I'm not saying that I'm the only one that\ncan give you this. But I took that class and it changed everything\nfor me. I had already written eight novels at that\npoint. I knew how to put my proverbial shoulder to\nthe wheel and write stories, but I did not know how to refine them, and I did not know\nhow to take them out and actually publish them. Dave taught me all of that. Dave eventually retired from teaching and\nmoved off to do other works, and the class was going to get cancelled. Some of the professors I knew at the time\ncame to me and said, \"Brandon, will you teach it?\" At that point, I had sold a book, but had\nnot published the book, so I was very much an unknown quantity. But they're like, \"We don't want the class\nto be cancelled. Will you take it over?\" That was 2004. So I took it over and I've had the class ever\nsince. My career since then has taken off, very fortunately. Everything's gone very well. But I haven't been willing to let go of this\none class, because I feel like this class was-- if you can point to a single moment\nin my career that was the most influential in me actually getting published, it was probably\ntaking this class in 2000, 20 years ago now. And so I thought it's a resource that I need\nto make sure keeps happening. So I try to format it in a way that it would\nhelp me as a new writer taking the class. That means we are focused on the nuts and\nbolts of writing. You can get, from other classes, great things\non how to kind of approach your theme and things like that. We're going to focus on plot, setting, character,\nand business. And we will have two weeks on each of those,\nwith some interstitials where I sometimes bring in other writers to talk about things\nthat I'm a little weaker in. Like Mary Robinette Kowal is going to be in\ntown and I've asked her if she'll come talk to you about writing short fiction, and things\nlike that. So I try to bring in some people who really\nknow what they're doing to talk about some of the stuff that I'm not quite as knowledgeable\nabout. The goal is that, like I said, we will use\na very nuts and bolts approach.", "279": " For the purpose of this class, I'm going to\npretend that you want to be a professional writer in science fiction and fantasy within\nthe next 10 years. You do not have to have that as your goal. Let's make that very clear. A lot of times in the arts, we, how shall\nwe say, we have this sense that is actually, I think, sometimes detrimental. And I can express this best by, I don't know\nif any of you writers have had this, but you tell your friends and your family, \"I'm working\non a book.\" And what do they immediately jump to? \"Is it published? How much is they gonna pay you for it?\" Like, that is the first thing that people\njump to, unless they jump to, \"Oh, you poor soul. You're never going to be employed.\" I once had that actually after I got published. It was really great. It was one of those things you dream about. Where you're like, \"Oh, maybe someday I'll\nbe able to actually answer this.\" And someone did. I was at a party and they said, \"What do you\ndo for a living?\" I said, \"I'm a writer.\" They said, \"Oh, so you're unemployed.\" I said, \"I hit the New York Times list last\nweek.\" It was great. It does happen.", "359": " Anyway. But you don't have to have, as your goal,\nthat you want to be a professional writer. You can write because it's good for you, and\nI really think it is. In our society, if someone came to me in their\n40s, like I am, and I'm like, \"What do you do?\" They're like, \"Oh, I love to play basketball. I go play every Wednesday.\" I would not jump to, \"When are you going to\nplay for the NBA?\" Probably not going to happen to a lot of 40\nyear olds who already aren't, like-- Let's just say, Utah Valley 40-year-old guys are\nnot going off to the NBA. But I would think, \"That's great. That's good for you.\" Going and being active and having a hobby,\ngoing and playing a sport, it's just really good for you. I sincerely believe that writing stories is\nthe same way, that simply learning to communicate better, learning to take the stories in your\nhead and put them on the page in a way that people will find engaging and will connect\nto emotionally, this is just good for you. So if you're in here because you're like,\n\"Hey, that sounds like fun,\" you are totally", "425": " welcome. If you've never written anything in your life,\nyou are totally welcome. If you are, like, thought you were signing\nup for Chem 107 and you got here, and you're like, \"Oh, no. I'm surrounded by nerds,\" you're welcome here. Whatever it is you want to do. If you don't even like sci fi/fantasy, if\nyou want to write literary fiction about boring people going through boring problems, you're\ntotally welcome here. Snide remarks notwithstanding. No, really. You are absolutely welcome to use this class\nhowever it can help you to achieve your own goals. Oftentimes, I have people who just love to\ngame. They are GMs. They're like, \"I want to build better worlds\nfor my players.\" Perfectly valid reason to take this class. I am going to pretend, during the hour and\n15 minutes that I teach this every week, that you want to be me in 10 years or less. You want to be living, full time, off of your\nwriting, and being very successful at it. I'm going to pretend that's the case. Because then I can give you all the information\nyou need, and then you can take it and pick out \nthe pieces that you want in order to make your writing goals happen, whatever they are. Okay? I do want to give a shout out to the people\nhere who do want to be Brandon Sanderson, or, you know, a better version of him. You probably, I don't know if your life was\nlike mine. You have probably been told many, many times,\n\"You can't do that.\" Or, \"Oh, um, that doesn't really happen to\npeople.\" I grew up hearing that from people that I\nloved and who were good intentioned. They really were, and they did have good points. My mother, whom I love, is an accountant. When I said I want to be a writer, she's like,\n\"Hmm. Maybe you should be a doctor, and then you\ncan write on the side, because all those doctors go golfing all the time. You could just go write stories.\" This was not terrible advice. But it does get a little disheartening when\neveryone you tell you want to do this for a living either says, \"Oh, great. Where's the money?\" Or, \"Oh, you poor fool.\" So I want to tell you something I learned\nby taking this class. Maybe one of the most important things was\njust that Dave showed up and said, \"Guess what? I'm a professional writer. I was a BYU student,\" in '85, I think he was. He took this class in '85 or '86. \"And now I'm a full-time, professional writer. Him just saying that made me say, \"Oh, wow. It can happen.\" And people say it's a one-in-a-million shot. Well, I bet I could add up how many people\ntook that class. There would be less than a million people,\nand Dave made it. When I took Dave's class in 2000, there were\n20 people in the classroom. Five of us went pro in one level or another. Now, some of us went pro as editors. Some of us went pro in that we published short\nstories in professional fields, but never earned a full-time living. But I was in that class. Dan Wells was in that class. Peter Ahlstrom was in that class. Peter went off and became an editor at Tokyopop,\nand then became a professional editor for them, and then I hired him. Kristy was in that class. She is now a professional, full-time freelance\neditor. So we have two editors and two writers I know\nabout who went 100% full time with their writing, and there were several others of us who went\nhalf time, which is where I get my fifth person. If you look at that and you're like, \"Wow. Five out of 20, that's kind of a one in four\nshot.\" I don't know, we might be a deviant group. But the chances are better than you think\nthey are. The problem is, if you went to, let's say,\nyour biochemistry class orientation and they said, \"One in four of you is going to be able\nto get a job in this field,\" you would probably be skeptical. Particularly if they said, which I kind of\nhave to say, judging by my former students, it's really more like one in 20. One in 20 of my students, ish, over the years\nI've taught this, have gone full-time pro.", "705": " If you showed up to law school and they said,\n\"Yeah, we're going to let one in 20 of you actually be an attorney,\" you'd be like, \"Uh,\nno!\" Well, what's the point then? So the chances are against you, but they're\nnot one in a million. And people that don't go pro that took that\nclass. For instance, I have someone in my writing\ngroup. She never went pro. She's writing professional quality work. She is a fantastic writer. But she likes to write a book every three\nor four years and publishing them is not as big a drive for her as simply telling her\nstories, because she wants to tell her stories. They're fantastic stories. I'm convinced she will sell one one day, pretty\nsoon.", "752": " That is not a fail state. You have to be willing to accept that that's\nnot a fail state. At one point in my career, this was after\nI'd taken the class but before I sold, I kind of had a come to Jesus moment. I guess I can say that at BYU, I probably\nshould have come to Jesus before then. But a metaphorical come to Jesus moment, where\nI'm like, \"What am I doing?\" At that point, I'd written 12 novels, and\nI had not sold any of them. I kept sending them out to publishers, and\nI kept getting two responses. Number one, \"Wow, these are long.\" Number two, \"Can't you just write more like\nGeorge Martin?\" No, he was the person that was selling right\nthen. His are big, so I don't know why they were\ncomplaining about the first one. They were really looking for Joe Abercrombie. They were like, \"Where is Joe Abercrombie? We know he's out there somewhere. We want to publish him.\" They wanted short, fast-paced, George R. Martin\nstyle stuff. They just were rejecting me right and left. I was not making any headway at all. I thought, \"Huh. Maybe they're right, all the people who say,\n'We're really worried about you, Brandon.'\" My dad would call and be like, \"Son, your\nmother's really worried.\" Yeah. I kind of had to ask myself, I'm like, \"What\ndoes my success look like? What am I willing to accept?\" I had to make the call that if I died, let's\nbe optimistic, in my 100s, right, with 150 unpublished manuscripts, was I okay with that? Was I going to keep doing this, even if I\nknew I would never get published? I realized, yeah, I would. I would keep going. Maybe I wouldn't go at the rate I was going. I would have to find a real job, for one thing. Grad school could only delay for so long. But I was going to keep writing. I was going to keep telling my stories. And I made the call that I was just going\nto keep doing this, even if I eventually never sold anything and never made a living. And that took a big weight off of my shoulders,\nwhere I realized\u2014 It is important to be chasing publication. I'm going to tell you guys how to do it. But you should be focusing on the fact that\nyou want to tell these stories, that it's good for you, that this is something you kind\nof have to do. And not in this sort of mystical way. A lot of writing classes I took would be like,\nyou'll know if you have to be a writer. And I hate that. Because I feel like writing is good for you. And I don't think there are people who are\npredestined to be writers and people who aren't. I do think luck plays a lot into whether you\nmake it full time. But you can divorce the \"I have to be professional\nand make a full-time living\" from the \"I just like telling stories.\" And that person, I don't think, I think anyone\ncan decide that. If you want to tell stories, tell stories. Don't listen to people who say, \"You must\nbe one of the chosen few.\" Um, no. Tell your stories. Tell them the way you want to tell them.", "957": " At the same time, I have to warn you, you\nmight not make it. You might spend the next 20 years of your\nlife writing books and never sell one. It's totally possible. In fact, it's more likely than you becoming\nme. That said, everyone I've known who stuck with\nthis 10 years or more, and has written the books, none of them regret it. Every one of them is like, \"Yeah, that was\ngreat. I'm so happy I did it. So happy I kept writing my stories. I'm sad I didn't sell. Yes, of course I am. I want to sell a million copies, Brandon,\nlike you did. But it's good for me. I like it. The stories are great. I enjoy them. And maybe someday I'll make it.\" You can shoot for that at the lowest level\nof success rate. I have written my stories. I've gotten better as a writer. I'm proud of what I've written, and maybe\nI'll make it someday still. Keep that in mind. All right. That's my kind of introduction number one\nto this.", "1021": " The introduction number two is, can you really\nteach people how to write? That's a question, but it fits. Can you really teach people how to write? This is something I have to ask myself a lot,\nlooking back at my life, my career, taking the class and things like that. What is the role of an instructor? Other than like, the most useful thing I think\nI could probably do is get up here and say, look, you've got to train yourself to write. You've got to spend 10 years, write a bunch\nof different books. Work hard at it. Write consistently. And that's 90% of what you need to do. That sentence right there will cover it. Almost every question you'll have for me in\nthis class, and I'll let you ask questions about what do I do, most of them will come\ndown to try a few things, practice some more, see if you get better, if you don't try something\nelse. That's most writing advice. So why am I here standing on a stage? In fact, it gets even kind of a little bit\nworse than that. Because writers will give you contradictory\nadvice all the time. You guys had this? Some of you are nodding. Go read a how-to-write book from a famous\nwriter like, Stephen King's On Writing is a fantastic writing book. You will read this, and he will talk about\nwhat you do to become a writer. You'll be like, wow, I guess I better do that. And then you'll read a different book from\nsomeone else and they'll be like, \"Do it this way,\" and it's completely different. I often use an example of this being discovery\nwriting versus outline writing. Writers tend to fall into two general camps,\nand really it's a spectrum that you fall along somewhere. The two general camps tend to be what, George\nMartin uses the term gardener, a discovery writer. I really like the term gardener. What a gardener does, is a gardener starts\na story with an interesting premise or some interesting characters, and they just explore\ntheir story as they start writing, and then they just kind of go wherever their winds\ntake them. George Martin is a gardener, pretty famously. Stephen King is probably the most famous gardener\nout there. They do not use an outline. For a lot of gardeners, if you have an outline,\nand you work really a lot on your outline, what happens is, your brain feels like you've\nalready written the story. You lose all excitement for working on the\nstory, and you get bored of it as soon as you start. Now, on the other side are what George calls\narchitects, another term I really like. An architect is someone who writes way better\nif they have a structure to hang their story on. Architects tend to work better in this way\nbecause what they can do is they can outline a whole bunch of stuff up front, and then\nwhen they're working on a given chapter, they don't have to worry about all the other stuff\nbecause they've already fixed that. They can focus in on this one chapter and\ndo this one chapter the way that they want to. The secret is, even the architects are discovery\nwriting. They're just doing it in smaller jumps. The architect is leaping between two bullet\npoints rather than into the complete unknown. But architects tend to hate revision. Architects tend to do way better with a structured\noutline. But these two are kind of opposites at their\nextremes. Doesn't mean you can't be a hybrid. But if you're the type of person that if making\nan outline ruins the process for you and destroys your ability to keep writing, then you can't\nfollow the advice that I have read multiple times from authors that say you must have\nan outline. So what do you do? Well, you have to learn when to ignore me. Me representing all the people giving you\nadvice about your writing. You have to understand that writing is really\nindividual, and there is no right way to write a book. There can be a lot of wrong ways for you,\nand there can be multiple right ways for you. That's part of the fun of writing. In fact, most writers use a different combination\nof discovery writing and outline writer tactics, depending on the book that they're writing\nat the moment. And they tend to evolve and change the more\nthat they come to understand their own process and the longer they go in their career. Really, this whole outline writer versus discovery\nwriting thing is a false dichotomy, but it's a model we use to discuss how a lot of writers\nwork and what might help you. You have to learn that whenever someone gives\nyou writing advice, they are saying, for me, this is what works. For me, I have found this experience makes\nme write stories that I like. You have to be willing to say, all right,\nmaybe I'll try that. I'll give it a go and see what happens. And treat these things all like tools in your\ntoolbox to help you write better stories. And if it doesn't work, you've got to be willing\nto throw it away. Now, maybe not throw it all the way away. Maybe put it in that toolbox and be ready\nto grab it later on when you change in your career. But you have to be willing to understand that\nall of these writing modes, these models, these things, this is just all stuff that\nwe come up with to try to explain what we're doing and to help us with problems. There's another thing I'd like you to understand. A lot of the stuff that I'll talk about in\nthis class is the sort of thing that writers, professional writers, start doing by instinct,\nrather than stuff that we always follow exactly to the T every time. What do I mean by this? Let me explain using a Magic: The Gathering\nmetaphor. We are in a sci-fi writing class, I once heard\na professional Magic: The Gathering player, which is my nerd obsession, talk about how\nthey got better as a Magic player. What they said is, when they first started\nplaying, there were so many little complex minutia about certain things in the game that\nthey had to focus on those little things just to make sure that they weren't making mistakes. The further they got playing, the more they\nrealized that by focusing on things they'd started to do those things by instinct, and\nthat they then had brain space to start focusing on higher level, and higher level, and different\ntactics in playing the game. What really happened as someone became professional\nas a Magic player was that they moved through doing more and more by instinct and having\nmore and more space in their brain to focus on different parts of playing the game.", "1434": " I think this absolutely is true for writing\nas well. I feel that the more I have written, the more\nby instinct I have been able to do simple things, such as cut the passive voice from\nmy writing while I'm just writing a rough draft. The more I've been able to, by instinct, understand\nthe pacing in this chapter is too slow. I need to speed it up, either by trimming\nup here, or by making this next part come faster, or by putting something in the middle\nthat gives us some sense of progress. You start doing these things by instinct,\nand what you can start doing is then thinking about bigger and bigger and more important,\nno, more important's the wrong term, but different things to improve your writing. What you're going to be doing as a writer\nis, you are going to, by practicing, you are going to start basically sticking stuff into\nyour instinct. Your long-term memory rather than your RAM? I don't know. Computer people, help me out. You put this in your BIOS? I don't know. I don't know computers. Don't worry about it. They get it. They get it. But you're going to be able to focus on different\nthings as you start writing, and other things will come to you by instinct. This is why the single best thing you can\ndo to be a better writer is to make good habits for writing consistently.", "1520": " Now, put an asterisk on that, because what\ndoes writing consistently mean? It's going to mean a different thing for almost\nevery person in this class, like I talked about earlier. For some writers, writing consistently means\nworking on their outline every day for eight months, and then spending four months working\n12-hour days on their book, completely binge-writing it and being done. I know people that that is their way of working,\nand every year consistently that's what they do. They write their book in four months after\nspending eight months fiddling with an outline. I know other people who are more like myself,\nthis is what I do, who get up and they write 2,000-3,000 words every day. I do it in two 4-hour sessions every day,\nvery consistently. Build a castle one brick at a time. Just keep on going. That is my method. For other people who are working day jobs,\nthey're like, that's a luxury, Brandon. I don't get to do that. What I get to do is I get to spend my lunch\nhour working on whatever outline I'm going to write for that day, and then when I get\nhome I have one hour after the kids go to bed that I can work on my story. Other people will be like, I can't even do\nthat. Four hours on a Saturday, that's my best I\ncan manage, four hours a week.", "1609": " This is going to be different for each of\nyou. But the goal is consistency. Your average writer writes somewhere between\n300 and 700 words an hour when they are working on new prose. If you fall a little under or a little above\nthis, no problem. Everybody's different. But your average writer's going to be in there\nsomewhere, with 500 words kind of being what a lot of people can do in an hour's work. That goes way up, by the way, if you spend\na whole week thinking about what this awesome scene you're going to write is, and then you\nonly get one hour to write it, and you zip out 1,500 or 2,000 words for that one hour. I've had times in my life where that's where\nI had to be. But on average, 500 words an hour. That means that if you can find four hours\na week, you can write 2,000 words. Your average novel is around 100,000 words. That's actually a little long for your average\nnovel. Which means that one year, you're going to\nwrite a book if you can only find four hours a week, one 4-hour session on a Saturday. If you can't find that, but you can get two\nhours a week, you can write a book in two years. Two years is a perfectly acceptable pace for\ndoing that. Consistency is going to trump binge writing\na lot of the time. But, asterisk, if you are naturally a binge\nwriter, then you should learn to work with that, and try something else because it might\nbe easier another way, but if it doesn't, then embrace this is how you write, and figure\nout a way to make your schedule work for that. It works really well for teachers, because\na lot of writing-- Writing is one of these jobs that's very hard to do if you have another\njob that takes a lot of your brain space. A lot of people ask, what are the perfect\njobs to get while I'm waiting to be a writer? I say, I don't know what the perfect job is\nfor you, but I can name a couple of them you probably don't want to do. One is be a computer programmer. I took one computer programming class in college\nat BYU 20-something years ago, and it was really instructive, in that it was the only\nclass that I would do my homework for, and then I would sit down to write and feel like\nI couldn't write because I'd already spent all this time and energy on writing code,\nand it felt like the same sort of thing. Your mileage may vary. It may be very different for you. You might be like, you know what? I'm naturally a better writer because I write\ncode. For me, writing code exhausted me for writing\nstories. Being a teacher is another one I hear from\na lot of people, that because being a teacher is one of those jobs you don't leave when\nyou leave school, that it's always work, thinking about the students, thinking about papers. This can make it really hard to be a writer. What tends to be really good is, like, laying\nbricks. No one tells you this in college. They're like, oh, yeah, go get an English\ndegree and get an English major job, when really, going and laying bricks tends to be\na really good job for a writer, because you can put on headphones, listen to music, and\ngo through your plot outline or what you're going to write that day, and then go home\nand be relaxed and sit in a chair and write it. Menial labor tends to actually be really great\nfor writers, for that reason. Kind of bizarre and inverse of what you would\nthink. Most of us don't have that luxury, the luxury\nof becoming a brick layer. Maybe I shouldn't phrase it that way. But most of us in a college setting need to\nmajor in something that then is going to lead to some sort of career similar to what they're\nmajoring in, and I get that. Most English majors are going to go get a\ntech writing job, or a copy editing job, or something completely unrelated to English\nbecause it's one of those generic degrees. But I had a lot of friends who became tech\nwriters, and they still were able to write their stories. So it's not like it's going to ruin you. If you're like, \"I'm 3-1/2 years into a computer\nscience degree, Brandon,\" totally can work. I have code monkey friends who write books. I'm just saying, it's going to vary for each\nperson. But this is what I found. I worked a graveyard shift at a hotel. I wrote from 11:00 PM until 5:00 AM every\nday, and that's how I wrote books when I was going to school full time and working full\ntime. I had quite the luxury in that. And you wouldn't think a minimum-wage job\nis a luxury. But having the privilege that I could just\nget a minimum-wage job, and I didn't have to worry about my finances so that was okay,\nI was really lucky and fortunate that I was in a position where I could work for $6 an\nhour. That was enough to cover all my expenses and\nI could write books at work. Most people can't do that. You can't just go give up your entire social\nlife, swap your sleep schedule, and work a minimum-wage job in order to become a writer. Worked for me. But maybe do as I say, not as I did. In this case, where are we going with this? You're going to have to figure out what works\nfor you. But if you can be consistent, if you can learn\nhow to do that, then you can make writing a professional endeavor to you, even if you\naren't intending to go pro, or if you never do go pro. Let's take a moment and just talk a little\nbit about, this whole day is just going to be orientation stuff. We'll talk about random things like this. I'll probably dig into the whole discovery\nwriting versus outline writer a little bit more, so that you understand kind of how the\nclass is going to go. But before that, let's talk a little bit about\nbeing a writer and having a real life. I think it's important to have a real life. We presume that we're going to be writing\nabout people's lives and telling stories about people's experiences. And if we don't actually live our own lives,\nthat's going to be much harder. I talk about this because the first day of\nclass 20 years ago when Dave taught this class, one of the things he said that stuck with\nme all this time, is he said, \"I have a lot of friends who say, oh, you shouldn't get\nmarried. You shouldn't have a family. That will distract you from your calling as\na writer.\" I haven't had that told to me a lot. I maybe move in different circles, but I have\nheard it happening. Dave said, \"I have found that having a family\nhas just given me way more to write about than if I hadn't.\" But there are some things I want to talk about\nwith this, to kind of help you guys as writers understand this.", "2007": " One of the biggest division points I've found\nin relationships among my writer friends, and this happens kind of unexpectedly, is\nthat the more consumed you become with your writing, the more other people in your life\nmight feel like they are being left out of something that is all-consuming and passionate\nfor you. This is a real issue, particularly with me\nup here saying you ideally want to try to write every day for an hour or two. Ideally, if you want to be doing this professionally\nin 10 years, you want to jump start that by writing two hours every day for the next 10\nyears. Finding two extra hours every day can be rough,\nparticularly if you have any kind of social life. Not everyone can be like me, working a graveyard\nshift and having no social life.", "2064": " What happens is, with a lot of my friends,\nand this actually, I notice this. Let me tell you it through eyes of my wife. Emily and I got married in 2006. So she didn't have to suffer through all of\nthe working a graveyard shift stuff. But she also didn't have to deal with Brandon\nthe superstar. She could just meet Brandon the wannabe new\nwriter. Emily and I, she came from the English major\nworld. She was an English teacher, and I was a writer,\nand a sometimes professor at BYU. And so we were quite the good match, and we\nhad a lot of interests in common. We get along really well. But I can still remember one time when I went\nout to dinner with Brandon Mull and Shannon Hale, and we were all out at dinner together. We were all chatting, and it was like this\nwonderful dinner. Connecting really well with these other authors. It was one of the early ones before I knew\nMull really well, and it was really fun to get to know him, this person that people kept\nbringing me his books on accident to sign. We both were like, when a kid does that we're\nlike, uh, we should probably just sign it anyway. The poor kid would be like, yeah, Mull, M-U-L-L. We don't do that. We usually sign each other\u2019s books and be\nlike, \"I'm the wrong Brandon, but I'm still going to sign your book because you waited\nall this time.\" By the way, okay, you get lots of asides in\nthis class.", "2161": " I thought I was, like, when I grew up in Nebraska,\nI was the only Brandon, like, in my school. It was a really original, interesting name. I'm like, my parents came up with this great,\noriginal, interesting name. And then I moved to Utah to go to BYU and\nthere were five in my freshman dorm. And then I realized, it's a Mormon name. Who would have thought? It's not in any of the scriptures, but it\ntotally is a Mormon name. There's a ton. Brandon Flowers. Brandon Mull. Brandon Sanderson. There's a lot of Brandons out there with an\nLDS background. Who knew? But anyway, I'm out to dinner with Mull, and\nwith Shannon, and we're chatting, and it's really great. We're sharing ideas about our writing and\nstuff like that. It was at, by the way, Mama Chus. You guys like Mama Chus? Thumbs up. After the dinner, I turned to Emily and said,\n\"Wasn't that the best dinner ever?\" She was like, \"You didn't look at me one time\nthe entire dinner. I just sat there and felt invisible.\" Yeah. And you're like, oh-h-h-h. Early in our marriage. I'm better now. I'm way better now. But this is a real thing that I've come to\nfind happens, that because the writers kind of get into their worlds, and they're doing\nthis thing that is, like, really cool. Writing is really cool. It's like this-- I don't like to get too mystical\nabout it, but you've got a blank page and you make something out of that. And it's like, what's in your brain, and someone\nelse reads it, and they imagine something pretty similar to that. It's like you can write things and people\nacross the world from completely different backgrounds can imagine this thing that you've\nwritten, and you've got a connection with someone that is completely different from\nyou, that you've never met. It's really cool. It's really this purely creative thing, where\nyou're taking nothing and making something from it. I love it. But you can get so invested in that that the\npeople in your lives feel really left out. So I'm going to give you this warning at the\nbeginning of the class. I'm going to, as a writer, push you to write\na lot. But I'm going to suggest that you also learn\nto balance your life. Because it's very easy to burn out as a writer. It's very easy to because so consumed by this\nthat it destroys aspects of your life. The thing that I've done, this is, again,\njust one of these tools to try, is that I started realizing that when I was with my\nfamily, I needed to be with my family. This was a hard transition for me, because\nI got married in my 30s. I had spent a lot of time learning to be a\nwriter, and one of the things you learn to do as a writer, particularly one who has to\nwork full time and go to school full time, is that you start to look for those moments\nwhen no one is asking you to do anything, and you use those to work on your stories. You carry around a notebook. You carry around your phone. Writers don't get bored, which is great. People are like, \"Oh, you were left alone,\nby yourself, waiting for me to show up for a half hour. I'm so sorry.\" And you're like, \"It was the only half hour\nthat no one bugged me all day. I got so much work done, even though it was\nall up here.\" I started to use driving time. It's great for this. Something about moving while you're going\nand thinking, is just really handy for coming up with ideas. This is why, by the way, Kevin J. Anderson,\naside, he goes on hikes and dictates all his books on hikes. He uses completely dictation software so he\ncan be moving when he's writing. I know other people who've tried it and it\nactually works for them. It's never worked for me, because I don't\nthink with spoken word the same way I do on the page. But I might be able to train myself if I really\nwanted to. But anyway, I was using all these moments. And so when I was driving somewhere, my wife\nwould say, \"I know when you're thinking about a story, because if I say something you jolt,\nand you look at me like, 'What have you just done? I was in Roshar and it was cool.'\" Now I'm in a minivan. Where is my Spren? I started to realize; this could take over\neverything. And if instead I started putting boundaries\nin place to contain the imagination, and then be with my family when I was supposed to be\nwith my family, my life would be better. So at 5:30, I am not allowed to work on books\nfrom 5:30 until 9:00. Doesn't matter if I have free time. Doesn't matter if the family is away or something\nlike that. I have this barrier in place, and it has been\nso good for my life. Because it's also good to kind of step out\ninto the real world. People accuse us of living in fantasy worlds. They don't understand. We're not living in fantasy worlds. We don't lose track of the real world. It's not like we are all these people who\nare schizophrenic and can't tell the difference between hallucinations and reality. That is no what it is. People always say that, and it always bugs\nme, because that's not what it is. I am constructing something. I'm building something. It's really engaging. It's really fulfilling. But it's not like I'm forgetting the world\nI live in, and things like that. Even if, when you interrupt me, I look like\nI'm really annoyed, because I kind of am really annoyed, because I was making a really cool\nconnection between two different parts of my story. That barrier lets me step out, live my life\nas it should be lived, interacting with other people, and it makes me that much more refreshed\nwhen I go back to writing. This is why I do two sessions, by the way. Partially because I don't want to get up in\nthe morning, because I'm a writer. I didn't do this job to get up at 8:00 AM. So I get up at noon. People are always asking me about it and they're\nlike, \"Oh, you learned that while you were working the graveyard shift.\" I'm like, \"That's right. I did all those years at the graveyard shift\nand it has changed me, and now I have to suffer and live with this whole off schedule.\" No, no. I was like this before the graveyard shift. I've always wanted, I like being up at night. People leave me alone. So doing two sessions, for me, from about\n1:00 until 5:00, and then about 10:00 until 2:00 is great for my writing, because I have\nthat time in between that just refreshes and relaxes me. I get to go do something else. And then when I sit back down to write, I'm\nexcited to do it again for another four-hour session. I recommend finding, and at least understanding,\nwhat this can do to the relationships in your life, and taking some steps, they don't have\nto be the steps I took, to make sure that it doesn't consume you to the point that it\nruins your ability to have good relationships. On the flip side, here are some tips you can\ngive to a spouse or roommates, that you can talk about with them, to help them understand. Because one thing that people don't generally\nunderstand about most writers, again, writers are different, so everyone's different, most\nwriters, takes us a little time to get into it. I don't know if this is the case for you. But you sit down with your laptop, and if\nyou were to time yourself, for me that first hour, that's not a 500-word-an-hour hour. That's like a 200 words. And then that third hour is like 1,000 words\nin an hour. And then, like the fourth hour I'm starting\nto run out of steam, and it's like an average one, and the one in between is like an average\none. So if I get interrupted for 15 minutes, after\nI've spent 45 minutes, like, really getting it going, what it does is it can reset me\nback to the first hour, the 200-word thing. What my wife didn't understand, and I didn't\neven understand at the time, is that a 5 to 15-minute interruption can mean more like\na 45-minute delay in me getting to that zone where the writing's really working for me. Learning that, if this is the case for you,\nand being able to explain this block of time, whatever it is, is so precious, because it's\nonly at the middle where it will really start coming and working for me. If you can get your friends and family to\nbe the guardians of that time, so that they have a part in it, so you're like, \"These\ntwo hours, make sure no one interrupts me, and then I will be with you after I have done\nthose two hours, because I will be so much more relaxed that I've gotten my writing done.\" My wife has learned this. She's like, \"Wow, if he gets his writing done,\neverything is great. But if he doesn't get his writing done multiple\ndays in a row, he starts to get really anxious.\" And she will tell people, \"Brandon hasn't\nbeen able to write in a couple of days. Give him some space.\" This is why tours can be miserable in part. But giving her that sort of connection to\nthe writing, letting her in to the brainstorming, when I talk about, \"Oh, I made this cool connection. Isn't this cool?\" has been really helpful\nfor our relationship, and for my career in multiple ways. She's really good at guarding my time. She makes sure that I don't get interrupted. In exchange, when, not only-- Best-selling\nbooks are really good for marriages, because you don't have to worry when the money is\ncoming in. If books aren't selling, it's bad for marriages,\nbecause it can be all the stress. So there is that. But there's also the idea that we're together\non this, and we have a shared goal and a shared focus. Let me ask, before I do some stuff on the\nboard, just about discovery writing. It's not actually stuff on the board. You'll understand in a minute. Any questions about what I've talked about\nhere, about writing life, about becoming professional, and how you're treating this? Q: How do you overcome the sense of despair\nthat you're not going to be able to make it? How do I overcome the sense of despair that\nyou're not going to be able to make it? This comes from a couple of places for me,\nor did back in the days. Because I spent a lot of time not making it\nuntil I did. One was, Pandora's box, I still had hope. It could always happen. There are a lot of writers who toiled in obscurity\nfor a long time, and then eventually sell. Don't let anyone tell you that if you haven't\nmade it in 10 years that you just will never make it. Go ask George R. Martin what people said to\nhim when he was a mid-lister for 30 years and barely was able to get people to read\nhis books, for a long time, writing great books, and then suddenly he became the best-selling\nfantasy author in the world. Yeah, there is that hope. You can always still make it. Another is, for me, learning to focus on,\nam I satisfied with the writing? Am I proud of what I've done? And making sure that I am. Because it's a real achievement to finish\nthings. I meet a lot of people who want to be writers. This class excluded, you want to bet what\npercentage of them actually finish a novel? Not very many. If you finish a novel, you are in a more select\ncrowd than the select crowd between people who have finished a novel and gotten published. The cutoff percentage, the fall-off percentage\nof people who never finish a novel is much larger than the fall-off between those who\nfinish a novel and get published. If you finish a novel, you are already in\na more select crowd, the most select crowd you could probably be in as a writer, if you're\nlooking at pure divisions of numbers, pure drop-offs between achieving certain goals. Be proud of the fact that you're finishing\nthings. If you're not, we're going to work in this\nclass on learning how to. Okay? Because that you have power over. Focus on what you have power over. You have power over whether you finish your\nstories. You have power over whether you're consistent. You have power over whether you are excited\nand interested in the stories you're creating. You do not have as much power over whether\nyou're going to make it or not. That helped me a great deal. Another thing is to be exploring other options. Self-publishing is a real thing. It's possible that you are totally of professional\nquality in your writing and you just haven't found an editor who's willing to give the\nbooks a chance, and you belong in self-publishing as an indie author. It's also possible that you write things that\nare so esoteric that you have a small potential fan base, but you can be satisfied that you\nare writing great books for them, and you are publishing the books for them, and you\nfind a job adjacent to being a novelist that is still really fulfilling to you. I mean, there are a lot of things to do, and\nnone of them are things, like, none of them are going to take away that despair entirely. Because there's a part of you that's like,\n\"I should be selling these books. These are really good books.\" Or, depending on your psychology, \"My books\nare terrible. I am terrible. What am I doing?\" That's equally likely. That one's more pernicious. Let's point that out. It is probably wrong. But that's what I did. Ask other people. Ask other writers. Make sure you're part of the community, and\nthings like that, because that can help. I got published because Dan Wells met an editor\nat a convention. The editor turned out to be a really good\nmatch for me and an only mediocre match for Dan, and Dan introduced me to the editor,\nand the editor bought my book. Having connections with other writers can\nbe really handy. What other questions do you guys got? Anything you want to throw at me? Yeah, over here. Q: How do you get into that writing community? How do you get into that writing community? Well, you are in the right place. Because after I talk about this next little\nthing for just a bit, we're going to split", "3034": " into writing groups, and that's part of this\nclass. We're going to talk about how to do writing\ngroups and stuff like that. Actually, you know what? We've only got 15 minutes left. Let's move on to that portion. I'll talk more about discovery writers and\nthings another day. Let's talk about writing groups. For this class, I am going to require the\npeople who are in the 15-person session, you know who you are, you've already applied and\ngotten in, we will go and chat in private after this. That's the class I go to after this. For those who don't know, there's a 1 hour\n15-minute lecture, and then I take 15 writers who have applied ahead of time and who have\ngotten in. They're chosen by Karen, my continuity editor,\nbecause I don't have time to do it anymore, from the applications. And then we do a writing group. We do a workshop. Taking this class gives you a leg up to where\nyou want to apply to that one. I will warn you, there's a lot more required\nof that class than this one. This one you show up, I give you an A. That\none, you're going to have to write a bunch. That's like, you pretend for a semester you're\na professional writer, and you're writing as much as that is, and you have to learn\nto juggle that with all the other things in your life, and it's training for that. That class, I mean, I require 30,000 words,\nis what I think we came up with. 35,000. 35,000 words in a semester. None of your other writing classes will ever\nrequire that much. I remember when I took a 518 class at BYU\nand they're like, \"You're going to have to submit twice, and both submissions have to\nbe 2,000 words.\" Half the class was like, \"Oh, no! How will I have that ready?\" I'm like, \"Seriously? That's an afternoon.\" So 35K. I'm going to require them to be in a writing\ngroup. The rest of you, I will not require to be\nin a writing group. But I will explain how you do writing groups,\nand I will give you the opportunity to split into writing groups to get practice. Now, here's the thing. Writing groups are also a tool that work for\nsome people and not other ones. Part of the reason I force the class to do\nit, the 15-person class, is I want them to give it a good, pun intended, college try\nat having a writing group. Because if a writing group works, it is one\nof the most useful tools for you in your writing career. I am still in a writing group with the people\nI formed a writing group from in this class 20 years ago. Okay? Dan's not in it anymore because he moved to\nNorth Salt Lake and he doesn't want to drive. But the other people are still in the group\nwith me, and they are the most useful group of people for bouncing ideas against, and\nthings like that, that I have ever had. When Dan was in the group, he got me published. Peter's in the group. Peter went off and became a professional editor,\nand then I finally hired him away when I needed an editorial director at my company. He is just invaluable. So meeting these people in this class was,\nthey were all in the class with me, and they're all still together, was super, super relevant. But let me give you the dark side of writing\ngroups. Okay? Dark side of writing groups. One really dark side of writing groups is,\nparticularly newer writers, don't know how to workshop. And one of the things they'll try to do is\nthey'll try to make your story into the story they would write, instead of a better version\nof the story you want to write. And that is the single worst thing that can\nhappen in feedback, is someone who is not appreciating the story you want to make, and\nthey want to turn it into something else. New workshoppers are really bad at doing this. In other words, they're really good at doing\na bad thing, which is trying-- And they're doing it from the goodness of their heart. They want you to be a better writer. They want to help you. The only way they know is to tell you how\nthey would do it, which can be completely wrong for your story. This is extra dangerous if you are by nature\nmore of a discovery writing. If you don't think about your story ahead\nof time, if you're not working from an outline, someone can come to you and say, \"Man, it'd\nbe so much better if you did this.\" And you're like, \"My story needs to have that. It was a romance, but now it needs a mystery.\" And the next week someone says, \"Oh, you know,\nif I were doing this, I'd make sure there were vampires.\" You're like, \" Romances have vampires these\ndays. I'd better write vampires into it. I mean, it was completely not a vampire story. It was a Regency, but now it's got vampires.\" And someone else is like, \"Oh, I don't really\nlike stories with female protagonists.\" And like, \"Oh! I'll change the gender so that everyone--\"\nYou can just go completely spiral out of control with people giving you feedback and you taking\nit too sincerely. Now, the good side of writing groups. The good side of writing groups is they can\nbe a really great support structure. Before you get published, having a goal and\na deadline for submitting is really helpful. And it's okay to have to have a deadline in\norder to submit. We all have different psychology. Some of us need a deadline, and so you can\ncreate one for yourself. There's nothing wrong with that. Having a deadline, having a support group\nof people who are going through the same things you're going through, also of people who are\nlikely to give you good feedback. A writing group that has been working with\nyou for a while are the types of people who will learn, hopefully, your writing style,\nlearn to like what you're doing, and they will be much better at giving you advice on\nmaking the story the way you want to make it, after they get to know you, and things\nlike that. You can cultivate a group who eventually will\ngive you good feedback, even though their feedback at the start is not that great.", "3416": " A couple of guidelines for writing groups. Okay? I assume that this light turns on. This is new from last year. We stood up here like [eight's bane] banging\nstones against it for a while and couldn't figure it out. I might have my AV guy come and try and figure\nit out. Eventually maybe we'll have a light up here. Until then, I won't write in the shadow. If you are a workshopper, giving advice, here's\na few points to give you. Try to be descriptive of your emotions, not\nproscriptive. Okay. Try to be descriptive. What this means is, particularly when you're\nnewer at this, saying, \"I was bored,\" completely valid. There's never a time when \"I was bored\" is\nnot a valid response to something you were bored by. Saying, \"You should add a fight scene\" can\nbe really bad advice. Sometimes it could be good advice. If you really know the person, and know the\nthing, and you know the submit-genre and what the writer's trying to do, you could be like,\n\"I feel like a fight right here would really snap things together.\" But it can be bad advice. \"I was bored\" can never be bad advice. It's always valid. Your response to the story always is. Now, the workshopee does not need to take\nthat. They can understand, well, maybe you're supposed\nto be bored. Or maybe this book isn't connecting and clicking\nwith you, and it's okay because someone else, that's their favorite scene. There are lots of reasons to not take that\nadvice, but that response is always valid. Saying, \"I'm confused,\" always valid. Doesn't matter if you missed something. It's okay to miss things. The writer needs to know if you've missed\nstuff. They may not have made it clear. Maybe you just missed it. Maybe your kids were crying, or maybe your\nroommates were doing a raid, whatever it is that people do, and there's like a Pok\u00e9mon\nthat everyone needs to catch and you're trying to read while they're all catching their Pok\u00e9mon,\nand you missed it, and nothing needs to be changed. But it's not invalid that you were confused. Let them know you're confused. Be descriptive rather than proscriptive. This comes from-- There's this great thing\nHollywood does, and I've loved it ever since. They do this test audience thing for a bunch\nof sitcoms, and they will get an audience together, show them the sitcoms, and then\nafterward ask them questions, and the questions are all about the advertisements, because\nit's not really a test audience for the sitcoms. They use the same three test sitcoms that\nnever expected to be aired. They want to get your reaction to the ads,\nand they don't want to tell you that upfront because they want to get your natural reaction. That's what the writer needs from you. They need your natural reaction as if you\ndidn't know you were going to be giving feedback on this. Just reading it and giving them the feedback\nso that they can be like, \"Oh, that's what I wanted,\" or \"Oh, I was totally surprised\nby that.\" If you're the workshopee, write it down and\ndon't change anything yet. That's what that says if you can't read it. My handwriting. Somewhere Mrs. Soukup, my 2nd grade teacher,\nis shaking her head, because she trained a best-selling author, and she warned him his\nhandwriting was bad, and she was not able to save him. If you're the workshopee, write it down, but\ndon't change anything yet. Give it some time. Give it some space. Listen to the feedback and try to understand. Try to get where they're coming from. And understand if that's a reaction you want. Sometimes you want people to be a little confused. Sometimes you want them to want something\nthey haven't gotten yet, because you're going to give it to them in a few chapters. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe you've done something wrong. They're having the complete wrong reaction. They're all laughing at this thing that you\nthought was really serious. Really important for you to know. But stay silent. Unlike whatever it is over there making noise. This is good advice, particularly when you're\nnew. Don't say anything. Pretend you are a fly on the wall and they're\nall sitting around having a book club discussion of the book, and you're just writing stuff\ndown. Prevent yourself from defending yourself. Prevent yourself from explaining. If you defend yourself, it's just going to\nmake people less likely to give you feedback in the future. If you explain it, then it defeats your chance\nto explain it right in the writing and have them get it, and you won't know if you are\nable to get them to understand it through your writing, because you've already explained\nit and tainted them. One more thing for the workshopper. Be sure to say what is good. The way we do our workshop is we start and\nwe make everyone say what is working up front, so the writer doesn't actually change the\nthings that are working. Plus, it's really good for you to get told\nwhat is working and that your writing doesn't suck before everyone launches in to telling\nyou how terrible your writing is. So we do a few minutes of that, and then we\ntransition to things that could use a second look, is what we call it in my writing group. It's not things that are broken. It's just things that the reader felt, things\nthat they want to highlight, that you may want to have a second look at, stuff like\nthat. All\nI think you guys are going to enjoy the class. I'll warn you, it's kind of like a firehose\nthing where I just talk a whole bunch. I try to make it entertaining, but if you\nfall asleep, I won't be offended. This is for you. Come with questions, because I will try to\ngive lots of Q&A periods where we can talk about things that are not working or working\nfor you. If you're interested in being in a writing\ngroup, hang out here. If you're not interested in being in a writing\ngroup, why don't you go ahead and take off, and then I'll deal with the rest of you. But anyway, enjoy the class. Thanks for taking it."}, "2": {"0": " Let's get started actually talking about sci-fi/fantasy. I'm going to start us off this year with plot. I do it randomly. Sometimes I start with character. Sometimes I start with setting. People often ask me, \"Where does a book begin\nfor you?\" It's really different for every book, and\nsometimes, in many ways, it's kind of a chicken or an egg sort of thing. I often say that stories are made up of these\nthree things. Plot, character, and setting. But they're glued together by conflict, and\nthat glue of conflict is the thing that oftentimes, I'll have a plot idea, or a character idea,\nor a setting idea separately from one another. I often use Mistborn as an example of this. Where did Mistborn come from? Well, Mistborn came from, I was reading Harry\nPotter, and I thought, \"Man, these Dark Lords never get a break.\" It's always some dumb kid comes along and\nruins the plan they've been setting up for a lifetime. Same with Lord of the Rings. So I'm like, what if Frodo got to the end\nof Lord of the Rings and Sauron said, \"Hey, my ring! I've been looking for that. Thanks. That must have been a really hard journey. Thanks for coming all this way.\" And then killed him and took over the world. I thought that was a bit of a downer of a\nbook to write. But I filed the idea away in the back of my\nhead as an idea. That would be a plot idea. A plot or maybe a setting. It's kind of like, what comes first. Is this a setting idea? Is this a plot idea? The idea of the prophesied hero failing is\nkind of a plot idea, but the idea that it turned into, a world where the prophesied\nhero failed, was a setting idea. These things all mix together. Separately, another time I was watching one\nof the Oceans movies, and I was reminded how much I love the heist genre. One of my favorite movies of all time is Sneakers,\na fantastic little film. I've loved it all the way going back, things\nlike The Sting, Michael Crichton's The Great Train Robbery, any sort of heist story. Inception is just a fantastic one. You can always grab me with a heist story. I thought, \"I don't think I've ever read a\nfantasy heist.\" I thought, wow, that would be really cool. You could give every member of the heist team,\nthe leverage team or whatever, a different magical power. So they could each be magical. You could do this whole thing. I was thinking of that separately. And that was another plot idea. The idea for the mist came as I was driving\nto visit my parents in Idaho and I passed through a fog bank at 75 miles an hour, or\nwhatever the legal speed limit is, which I was obviously going, because we're being recorded.", "190": " I passed through and I'm like, \"This visually\nlooks really interesting, hitting a fog bank and going into it.\" I\nequated that in my head with a visit to the National Cathedral in D.C., which I had seen\nat night. Normally, I'd been inside of cathedrals and\nseen the stained-glass windows from inside with the light coming in from outside, but\nthis time they had them lit from the inside at night, shining out, and I loved that visual\nimage. Those became two setting details. This idea of the mist, of the fog, of this\nkind of almost living mist, and this visualization of cathedrals in the mist shining out light. Those ideas kind of combined together with\nthis character I was developing of Kelsior, all separate. Feruchemy was designed separately from allomancy. If you haven't read the books, there are three\nmagic systems. Two of them were designed for separate stories,\nand when I combined them I liked them better. And then I designed a third one in my plotting\nand world-building sessions. For me, I write down all these ideas. They just go in my notebook, or in my file\nin my computer that's called Working Ideas right now. It's just big lists of ideas. A book grows out of multiples of these ideas\ncombining together. When I have something that feels like the\nseed of a novel that's working, I'll often go back to my book and say, are there any\nother ideas in here that mesh really well with these ideas. I often describe, ideas are like these little\natoms bouncing around. When they mash into each other, they create\nsome core reaction, become something new. It's not how actual science works, but, you\nknow, it'll work for the fantasy author. Suddenly you've got this thing growing of\nall these different atoms coming together and making some cool new thing that is somehow\nmore than the sum of its parts, more exciting at least. That's the story for me. Then I go and I kind of plug in things. I'm like, what else have I been thinking about\nthat might work for this story, and I plug those in. Then I build those all in an outline that\nI'll talk about during our second plotting session, kind of how I build my outlines. At that point, I'll find holes, and I'll just\nstart plugging things in. I'll start brainstorming. I'll start saying, I know I need another idea\nhere. Let's put it together. Most of the time, a book is not one idea. This is where newer authors sometimes have\nproblems. They pick one really good idea and they try\nto write a book on it. You can write a short story on one idea pretty\nwell. A book generally needs a mashing together\nof multiple ideas. It doesn't mean you have to have been struck\nmagically by the idea fairy and have this", "360": " brilliant idea that couldn't ever be reproduced. That's not how ideas work. You just need different hooks and things to\nmake you excited and to get the audience excited. Ideas are actually cheap. My favorite story about ideas being cheap\ncomes from Jim Butcher. I've confirmed this with him, so I know it\nactually happened, but I heard it thirdhand originally. The story goes that during his days unpublished,\nJim Butcher, who is now famous for writing The Dresden Files, among many other wonderful\nnovels, Jim was on a forum of aspiring writers, and he got in an argument with someone who\nsaid, \"Some ideas are just so grand and so great, that's what makes a writer.\" Jim was making the argument, the same one\nthat I often make, which is ideas do not make the author. Authors make the ideas work. If you give bad ideas to a good writer, you\nwill generally get a really great book. If you give good ideas to someone unpracticed,\nit's still going to fall apart. Jim and this other person got in an argument\nonline. Finally, Jim said, \"Give me your two worst,\nor at least most incongruous ideas, and I'm going to write a really good book using them.\" They said, \"All right, I want you to take\nthe lost Roman legion and mash it together with Pok\u00e9mon.\" Jim wrote an entire epic series called Codex\nAlera, which is basically the lost Roman legion gets Pok\u00e9mon in a fantasy world. It's a great series. I recommend it. It's an epic fantasy, it's really cool, and\nit's actually very distinctive because some of those ideas are very distinct ideas. But the skill of a writer is what readers\nand editors are looking for. I don't know if I said this last week, but\noftentimes writers will come and be like, \"Oh, man, editors reject people so quickly.\" But they really can reject very quickly. If I were to bring up here, roll out this\npiano, and have two people play on the piano, one picked up the piano last year, they're\nnot a complete noob, but they've been working at it assiduously these last eight months\nor whatever, and have gotten decent, and then we brought someone in who is 20 years practiced\nconcert pianist and really knows their stuff, how soon do you think you could tell? Right away. An editor or a reader can generally tell after\na few pages that same thing. Now, readers tend to be a little more forgiving\nthan editors, in that readers can like the ideas and themes, even if the writing isn't--\nthey will notice, but they're like, it doesn't bug me. And that's just fine. But people can tell by instinct which things\nare working better than others, even if they themselves are not experts in that field. You can, unfortunately, get judged very quickly\nbased on your writing. That means that your ideas, however cool they\nmay be, most of the time people aren't going to get to your cool ideas if you can't write\na great scene starting off. That's what we\u2019re really looking for. We\u2019re looking for the skill of someone who\nhas practiced their craft and has really learned to be able to grab an audience quickly and\nconvince them that the story is worth reading. Today we're going to focus on doing that with\nplot. It's equally important to character and setting,\nthough I would actually rank setting the least important of the three if I had to rank them. I may tell this story again. I tend to do that. But if you think about it, we're all in this\nroom because we want to do sci-fi/fantasy. It's a sci-fi/fantasy writing class. You would think that setting would be the\nmost important. Did I say this last week? That a story that has a great setting, but\nterrible characters generally is still a bad book. But a story with a cliched and/or not that\ngreat setting but great characters, still generally a fantastic book. It could be better. You wish you would have all three really strong. But in some ways, setting is the least important\nof these three. We are going to talk about plot today. Really, before we dig into the nitty gritty\nof how do you actually construct a plot, and things like that, I want to talk about what\nwe mean by plot, and why plots. Why some work. Why some don't. Why readers get bored sometimes, even if exciting\nthings are happening. Why readers can find \"boring things\" very\nexciting if they're written in a certain way. If you're going to practice something, learning\nhow to do this, learning how to make things interesting, to pull a reader page by page,\nthere are few skills as useful to a writer. I think the most important one, at least for\na fantasy/sci-fi writer, is the ability to convey information in an interesting way,\nkind of this whole avoiding info dumps, instead using characterization for info dumps. But number two would be the ability to understanding\nwhat your promise, progress, and payoff is when it comes to constructing a story. Promise, progress, payoff. Now, we're just going to go down these three\nand I'm going to talk at you for a while. We will start with promises. Stories all make a promise. In fact, they usually make several at the\nbeginning of the story. Being in control of your promises and what\nyou're making is a sign of mastery of the art. Simply writing your story and seeing where\nit goes is fine.", "730": " But either during revision, or during planning,\nor during outlining, you should be asking yourself, how am I making the correct promises? There are several types of promises you're\ngoing to make. One is what we call a tone promise. A tone promise is where your introductory\nchapter's job is, in part, to indicate the tone and style of story that you're going\nto be telling. If you're going to have a wacky comedy, don't\nstart your story with someone dying really tragically and really making us weep. That's hard to do in a prologue, but you can. But don't start with the prologue to Eye of\nthe World if your story's going to be a wacky comedy. If you haven't read Eye of the World, the\nbeginning is a man finding out that he's gone crazy, having his sanity restored just long\nenough to realize he's murdered his entire family, running off and committing suicide. That's the prologue to Eye of the World. Yeah, he creates a mountain as he commits\nsuicide, so that's cool. But if the next chapter, where the wacky hijinks\nof a talking donkey and his friend the ogre, then you would justifiably say this tone premise\nwas inaccurately presented. Now that's an extreme example, but this is\nsomething that I notice a lot of writers don't necessarily have fluency over and control\nover, is what kind of promises you're making at the start of your stories. This is why, Hollywood does this too, but\nthis is why the cold open is so popular. The cold open is where you join a character\nin the middle of an adventure that is a microcosm for the adventure that the entire story is\ngoing to be. The classic example of this is Indiana Jones\nand the Raiders of the Lost Ark. If you haven't seen that movie, shame on you. If you haven't seen that movie, it starts\noff with this fun, but very kind of solemn romp about Indiana Jones going into the jungle,\ntrying to get this idol, being betrayed, and failing. That is your setup. Your setup to Indiana Jones' character is,\nhe's awesome, but he's kind of an everyday guy in some ways, because no matter how hard\nhe tries, he just ends up failing at the end anyway. That is kind of your introduction. What is the story going to be about? Adventure. It's going to be about someone who has an\neveryman characteristic that is really, really cool, but you can pretend that it's a normal\nperson, who's probably going to get kicked around a lot, dropped into vats of snakes,\nand at the end maybe win, maybe not. That's what the cold open is there to do for\nyou. But your promise is, Indiana Jones tries really\nhard, you are going to have a good time, and this is going to be awesome. They're setting a tone promise for you with\nthe opening to that story. One of the reasons why the prologue is so\npopular in fantasy, to the point that it's almost a clich\u00e9, is because a lot of fantasy\nwriters realize having a kid start off on a farm at the beginning of their story doesn't\nconvey the right promise of action and adventure, so they start with something that has a lot\nof action and adventure, and then move to kid on the farm. Now, I'd like to point out this is not the\nonly way to make a kid on the farm have this sort of tonal promise. But you'll notice that Star Wars, does it\nstart with Luke on the farm? No. It starts with a small ship and a large ship\nshooting at it, and then a firefight, a spunky princess, and goofy droids. Your cold open tells you everything, and then\nit cuts to Luke, and you get the last piece, where he's looking at the binary sunset and\nthe Force theme plays. Then you've got basically your whole story,\nthe tone, the tone promises. I visited Pixar once, and they have something\nreally cool that they showed me, which is they will try to set the tone of their movies\nby the color palette that are used for given scenes. They actually have, up on their wall, they\nhave a several pixel wide sliver of color that is the average color for a given shot,\na given second of screen, and then they just put them all together, and you can watch the\ncolors change. It's really cool with WALL-E. Gray, gray,\ngray, gray, brown, black, black, blue, bright blue, bright blue, green. It's a cool way that they try to set the tone\nof their stories, just by using the color palette. You can't do that, but you can set the tone\nof your story with the words you use and the type of scene you use to introduce your story. I will warn you that the epic fantasy prologue\nhas become a little bit of a clich\u00e9, and so you have to work a little harder than you\nmight once have had to do in this, because people are used to the story of action hero\nbeginning, get some information that's important, dies passing it on to someone, cut to kid\non a farm. And/or young prince or princess who is inexperienced\nand wants to go out and see the world or something. Those beats are very well played. Now, anything done really well stops being\na clich\u00e9. The cliched part is when it stops having the\nimpact on your audience. If you can do it in a way that still has the\nimpact you want on your audience, it's not a clich\u00e9 anymore. The reason clich\u00e9s are bad is because they\nhave been taken and removed from their original intent to the point that people no longer\nget the original intent from the words. They instead bring all the baggage that the\nclich\u00e9 has, and it just feels lukewarm to them. So promise. Number one thing you're going to want to look\nto in your promise is your tone. Another thing you're going to want to look\nto in your early promises, is you're going to want to promise us, if possible, your character\narc. You don't have to promise what the arc is\ngoing to be, but you do want to promise the thing missing in a character's life that they\ncannot have, and the obstacles that lead to them being unable to have it. You want to show us your character's desires\nand what's preventing them. Now, sometimes you do this is a reverse way. Sometimes you show us what we know the character\nshould want, and show the character not wanting that. That's also very common. This is the Bilbo at the start of the Hobbit\nsort of thing. Where we all want Bilbo to go on an adventure. We know from the way the writing is written\nthat he goes on an adventure. He thinks he doesn't want to go on an adventure. We're going to then cheer for him to go on\nthis adventure as he comes to realize he wants to go on an adventure. The best part of the Peter Jackson Hobbit\nadaptations is that sequence in the movies. I will just leave that one thing there.", "1190": " But that part of the Hobbit movies was done\nbrilliantly, and really even took what was in the books and took them a step forward,\nthat realization that Bilbo wants to go on this adventure. But showing us a character who has a need,\nwho has a desire, who has a flaw, has a problem they're working on in their life, some sort\nof promise that tells us who's our main character, or one of our main characters, and what's\ntheir arc kind of going to look like if at all possible. Then the third thing you'll want to do is\nindicate what kind of plot you're going to be giving us. This can be your actual plot. This can be-- I divide plot into two different\nthings in my head. It's sometimes been hard. I explain it different times in different\nclasses. But there's something I will call the umbrella\nplot. The umbrella plot is, in some ways, your visible\nstructural plot. Then you have your core plot, which is what\nyour actual progress and payoff is going to be. Let me explain what I mean by this. A lot of books and movies are romances. This is your core plot. Will they get together? But a lot of those romances get transposed\nto an umbrella plot of, we need to do X, and while we do X we're going to fall in love,\nand that's what you actually care about. Now, the romance genre tends to not use the\numbrella plot. But a lot of other genres will be like, well,\nit's a fantasy novel. The core plot, what we really want people\nto read about, is these two characters falling in love. But our umbrella is, there's an alien invasion\nand we're going to run away from the aliens. These two things can be separate things, and\nthat's okay. But a lot of times you want to indicate one\nof the two, and often it's the umbrella plot that you are going to get to, and sometimes\nthose are the same thing. You want to give us a promise of what type\nof story we're getting into, if you can. Sometimes this is hard. Sometimes you're going to be waiting till\nthe end of Act I to actually really get us into this. Because sometimes you are following one of\nthese classic archetypes, where the main character doesn't want to leave their comfortable home\nand go on an adventure and become a better person and learn all the things they want\nto do. In those cases, you want to focus on the character\narc, and you want to find a way to promise that the tone is going to be what you want\nit to be going forward. Let's stop and talk, see if you guys have\nquestions on this kind of concept. It'll become more clear as I dig into the\nnext thing, because progress is where this kind of starts to click. But any questions on promises? Yeah. Q: You're talking about the first chapter,\ncorrect? The question is, \"We are talking about the\nfirst chapter. Correct?\" We are not necessarily talking about the first\nchapter. But that's a great question. We are talking about the introduction to the\nbook. This can be one chapter, but it can be a sequence\nof chapters. It really depends on how long we're talking. If you're writing a short story, this is your\nfirst couple paragraphs. If you're writing a massive epic fantasy,\nreally, we don't get all of these things, tone, arc, and plot, in Stormlight Archive,\nuntil really chapter 11. That includes two prologues that aren't in\nthere. So chapter 13. If you've read Stormlight Archive, where I'd\nsay we get all of this connecting together, where we've finally finished all this part,\nis when Kaladin makes the decision to save Bridge Four and turns back from the thing. There are earlier promises of what it's going\nto be, and I used the tone promises, but this whole part is kind of finished then. Q: For Eye of the World, would you consider\nthat beginning part when he leaves the village, or [_____]. I would say leave the village. In fact, Robert Jordan gets almost all of\nthis stuff by the end of chapter 1. You've got the prologue, Dragonmount, and\nthen, if you haven't read it, chapter 1 starts with kid on farm. But you only have, like, three paragraphs\non kid on farm until the kid on the farm sees this shadowy figure chasing him, and they\ngo to town and everything starts to be odd and strange, and there are strangers in town. The immediate promise of that is, you saw\nall this action. Somebody killed himself. Now we're learning that someone out there\nis a dragon reborn and might go crazy. Plus, we are learning everything's wrong in\nthis kid's village. Then by the end of chapter 1 or so, I'm not\nexactly sure, but the end of the first little short sequence, we have the attack, and everything\ngoes crazy. It's really fast in Eye of the World. I would say it's right about there. But really where this ends is where they decide\nto leave. Then you know what kind of plot you have. We're going to go on a travelogue. We know what our arc is going to be. We've got this whole kind of promise that\nour characters are small town people who thought they wanted big adventure, and big adventure\nis way more dangerous and scary than they think, and that's going to kind of be their\narc. We have our tone promise of Dragonmount, followed\nby village, everything's creepy, something's wrong, and that covers it. Go ahead. Q: What's the difference between the character\narc promise and the plot promise? Great question. What's the difference between the character\narc promise and the plot promise? Character arc promise is how the character\nis going to change during the course of the story. Your promise for the character arc is a promise\nthat they're going to change, or at least their situation is going to change and give\nthem what they want. I kind of intertwine these two. If you look at Luke, part of the promise is\nhe's going to be able to go up into the stars. But part of that promise that we don't quite\nget there until we get to Obi Wan saying, \"You must learn the ways of the force.\" That's the final end of, you're going to have\nto stop being this person and become one of these people who can fight in this big war\nthat we saw the starship starting. But those are character promises. Your plot promise is that is, the Empire is\nevil. We need to get these plans to the people who\ncan then defeat them, and that's your plot. Your plot is, get the plans to the rebels,\nand then you have a twist. We'll talk about twists. You have a twist in that actually we're going\nto go destroy the Death Star. That's a twist ending. It doesn't sound like one because we've all\nseen Star Wars. But it's actually one of the forms of twists\nthat I'll talk about later. Do you see the difference between character\narc and a plot, story arc, I would say? Yeah. Q: How do we make sure that we are predictable\nenough to have the promises, and not predictable enough to be predictable? Right. Great question. Wow. Okay, so the question was, how do we be predictable\nenough that we are giving promises, but not so predictable that we're boring, that we're\npredictable. There are a couple of answers to this. One of them is, generally, you can be, with\nyour plot, a little more predictable than you think, as long as you are giving interesting\nsetting and characters we care about. A lot of people talk about how many stories\nthere actually are. There's only five stories, or whatever. You can find those online. The truth is, almost every plot that has been\ndone, obviously ever plot that you conceive has been done. Most of the ways to buck the trend in those\nplots involves doing something so unexpected that it breaks your promises. Now that can become a feature of your story. But most of the time, you want to do subtle\ninversions of the promises. For instance, you give the promise-- I remember\nreading Eye of the World, which this shouldn't have been a big inversion, it just shouldn't\nhave, but it was, when the Gandalf character was a woman. I'm like, oh, I haven't seen that before. I've read a ton of these fantasy novels, and\nthere's always Gandalf, or there's Allanon, or there's Belgarath, or there's always the\nwise wizard. When the wise wizard shows up and it's a woman\nwho you don't trust, then that's different. I'm like, I know what role this person is\nfulfilling, but they're doing it in a different way. I am intrigued. Why don't I trust her? Should I trust her? Is this Gandalf? Is this not actually Gandalf? Again, that shouldn't have been a big inversion. It should have been-- It shouldn't have taken\nuntil that book to have a character who is not a white dude be the Gandalf character,\nbut it was for me, as a 15-year-old reading it. You can do subtle inversions, or subtle plays\non this quite a bit, to not be so expected. It comes down to, if you have a mastery over\nthe form. If you say-- Mistborn is a heist. I promise you very early on, Mistborn is a\nheist. It has all the classic characteristics of\na heist. But the fact that most people had not read\na heist where everyone has a different magical talent was new. The fact that we are recruiting someone into\nthis team and training them in an apprentice plot, a master-apprentice plot, at the same\ntime as pulling off a heist, was something new. A lot of people talk about, I use Terry Rossio. He's the screenwriter who wrote Pirates of\nthe Caribbean, one of the two, with his writing partner, and Aladdin. He talks about this idea. He's calling it the strange attractor. This is why you hear so often in Hollywood,\n\"It's this meets this.\" The strange attractor idea for a story is\nyou want to have your story feel familiar but strange at the same time. Oftentimes what you do is you take a new spin\non a familiar idea, or you take two familiar ideas and mash them together in a way that\ndoesn't feel like it would make sense but is intriguing. Mistborn is actually a heist movie in a fantasy\nworld, mashed up with My Fair Lady.", "1823": " That's part of why Mistborn works. That mashup, you know both of those plot archetypes. You know about the orphan who is taken in\nand trained to act all upper crust and things like that. You know heist story is. But both of those things in a fantasy book\nyou haven't seen before. What you're going to do, in part, is you're\ngoing to do this in a new way, or you're going to do it really well. Harry Potter is a perfect example of this. I don't think many people were surprised,\nwho have read a lot of fantasy, by the plot of Harry Potter 1. But it was fantastically done, and there is\nsomething magnificent about seeing somebody really good do something really well that\nyou want to enjoy. This is why people read a lot of romance novels,\neven though they know these two characters are going to get together. Even though the plot is predictable, watching--\nLike, I know how Hamlet ends. I will still go see Hamlet performed by actors. You don't have to twist everywhere, but I\nwill talk about how to twist also. All right, back here. Do you need a chair, by the way?", "1892": " I think there are a few seats here. I could have people raise hands. If you've got a seat next to you empty, raise\nyour hand, just in case someone in the back wants one. You guys can glance at those. You can stand back there if you would prefer. Q: Do all good characters have to have arcs? For instance, Indiana Jones--\nGood question. Do all good characters have to have an arc? There is a category of character that I believe\nJim Zub, the comic artist, dubbed. He called them iconic characters. These are characters that do not change story\nto story, and you can read their stories out of order, and you enjoy them for a different\nreason than seeing a character's arc. So, no. For instance, James Bond is the classic example\nof this. James Bond, sometimes, depending on who does\na James Bond story, will have a character arc in a given movie. That's generally what they do nowadays. But classic James Bond, classic Conan, classic\nSherlock Holmes. Sherlock Holmes did not have arcs in most\nof his stories. Sherlock Holmes is an iconic character. In Sherlock Holmes, your tone and your plot\npromises are way more important than promising some sort of character arc. It is not required. If it going to be a major feature of your\nstory, then you do want to give a promise to it. But if it's not, you instead show them being\niconic and say, this is why you want to read about this character. They are just cool to watch, or to read, or\nto, you know, experience. Go ahead. Q: Why do some promises work to capture readers'\ninterest and make them want to keep reading, while other kinds of promises don't work?", "1994": " Why do some promises work to capture readers'\ninterest and keep them reading, while other promises don't work? Some of this is taste. This is something you're going to have to,\nas writers, become used to, is that different people have different tastes, and there is\nnothing wrong with that. Okay? You can make the very best salmon in the world,\nand I will hate it. I do not like fish. I have a visceral reaction to fish. I gag if I taste it. It makes me feel ill to try to eat. Doesn't matter how good that salmon is. You're not going to get me to enjoy eating\nthat meal. You might get me to appreciate how much work\nyou did and how well you made that salmon. In the same way, some of this comes down to\ntaste. Taste can be really tricky, in part because\nthe experience of your reader influences their taste a great deal. The more you experience, the more you will\nfall into the \"I like these things, I don't like these things,\" and you may start to develop,\nnot everyone does, the \"I just want something different.\" I've tasted these things so much I want something\nnew. You see this in a lot of movie reviewers. There are some movies, that if you see a hundred\nmovies in a year, this is your favorite movie, and if you see one movie a year, it's your\nleast favorite movie. Books have this too. You can call this the Aragon effect. When Aragon came out, a lot of people read\nit and said, \"I've read this before. This is Star Wars or Dragon Riders of Pern.\" And yes, it was. But of course, Star Wars was taking that from\nother stories, and so was Dragon Riders of Pern. I'm sure there were people who saw Star Wars\nand were like, \"What? People like this? I've been reading John Carter books forever\nand it's just kind of that.\" They even used the word Sith for the bad guys\nin those, I think. There maybe people who read your book and\nbe like, \"This is just too straight down the archetype for me.\" There may be other people who read it and\nare like, \"This is a perfect version of this archetype, and I haven't experienced it very\nmuch.\" And so they just really love it. You shouldn't, as an author, I think, be making\nvalue judgements on those things. You can definitely decide what you want to\ndo and what your audience is. That's part of it. Why do some promises work also when others\ndone? Skill of the author is going to play into\nit. Whether you can start making good on those\npromises or not. I'd say it divides between skill and what\nthe reader wants. Okay? All right. Let's talk about progress for a little bit. Because this is the most important of them,\nI think. You would think the payoff is the most important,\nand in one element it is. Payoff is most important sometimes because\nit is the feeling you leave the reader with when they put your book down at the end. That can very much influence whether they\npick up another one or not. However, getting them to that end is more\nimportant. The host of writers who have fantastic progress\nsections and weak endings, who are still very famous and popular authors, should prove to\nyou that this is the most important of them. The host of authors who have limp beginnings,\nbut really spectacular characters and plot in the middle, followed by \"and then it ended,\"\nwho are still very, very popular writers, should tell you this. Because progress in the middle is the hardest\nof them, and it's where some of the great writers excel. Stephen King is the quintessential example\nof this. What do I mean by progress? We're going to go over here for progress. I started to figure this out early in my career\nwhen I was reading a book by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Forgive me, those of you who have heard this\nstory before. The book is Inferno by Niven and Pournelle. Not their most famous. A lot of people have heard of them because\nof The Mote in God's Eye. Or Larry Niven wrote Ringworld, which was\nthe inspiration for Halo. These are two fantastic science fiction authors. Inferno is about a science fiction author\nwho goes to a party, gets drunk, falls out a window and dies, and wakes up in The Inferno,\nDante's Inferno. Inferno is a classic style science fiction\nbook. What I mean by that is, a lot of the old school\nscience fiction books felt very episodic. This is because the authors were either serializing\nthem in magazines or were accustomed to doing so. Inferno reads like, we have this adventure\nwith famous dead person. By the end of the adventure, the mini adventure,\nyou figure out, \"That's probably Billy the Kid, isn't it?\" Then Billy the Kid is left at one part of\nthe Inferno, and the main character continues on to the next part of the Inferno and has\nanother wacky adventure with some perhaps famous person, with a lot of imagination showing\noff a fantasy writer's take on what it would be like to travel through hell. I was reading this book and I was compelled\npage by page, and normally I'm not in these episodic stories. I can still enjoy them. But usually I finish a story and I'm like,\neh, I'm done. But each time I had to turn the page and keep\nmoving. I asked myself, why do I read like I'm reading\na thriller, thrillers are a genre that specializes in always making you turn the next page, when\nI'm reading this goofy adventure in hell that's very episodic. I realized one thing had made the difference. There was a map at the front of the book. Now, we laugh at this because I may have,\nmaybe, a thing for maps. It's possible that you may have noticed that\nthere are a lot of maps in some of my books. So you're like, \"Of course you noticed the\nmap, Brandon.\" But this was not an epic fantasy story. But it had Dante's Inferno as a circle, where\nhe started out here at the end and was moving toward the center. And the question of, what's at the center\nof hell and can he get out, was so compelling that I had to read each next adventure, because\nI could watch as he moved steadily inward. This is a really powerful sensation in readers,\nand it is part of what draws people to books and why they read. Every book has this by virtue of the pages\nin the book that the reader is watching count toward an endpoint as they go. Even if they aren't watching the actual numbers,\nwatching themselves get through the book. There is a natural time bomb to reading a\nbook. That's progress, that you, as the reader,\nbeing able to sense that you are progressing through a story, is fundamental and vital\nto making stories page turners. When you say page turner, most people's mind\nwill go to something like a thriller, where something is always exploding, someone is\nalways chasing you, and things like that. But you can write a page turner about anything. Does not have to have a single fight in it. No one has to be running anywhere. The page turner mentality is about you indicating\nto your reader that progress is happening and giving them a sense that it is building\ntoward something that they want to see. This is a sense of progress. It is an illusion of progress. Because you have absolute control over this. If you wanted to, you could pass a thousand\nyears in one sentence. \"And a thousand years passed.\" I would guess that most of you in this room,\nif I gave you the challenge, saying you have to write 20 pages on the time between the\nsecond hand moving from one second to the next, you could do it. It'd be boring, probably, but you could do\nit, just describing everything in the room and making everything slow down, and sticking\nwith this moment, adding three flashbacks. You could, if you needed to, fill the whole\nbook and make it take one second. You have absolute control over this. One of the big complaints that people who\ndon't read a lot of fantasy or sci-fi make about it, is the complaint of, oh, they can\njust make anything happen, so there is no tension. This is, in one way, true, but it's a much\nlarger problem in scope than they think, because you can do that in any genre. If you are writing a romance, you can say,\n\"And he got over himself and they got together.\" Takes one sentence. \"And then he got over himself. And they found a whole bunch of money that\nher uncle left them that they didn't know. Suddenly they could pay off the house\" and\nthe evil whatever person who was loan sharking them and stuff, and the fact that they no\nlonger had that tension made their relationship problems go away and they lived happily ever\nafter. You can do this in any story. We'll talk about how to not do this when we\ntalk about Sanderson's First Law. But progress is absolutely, 100%, in your\ncontrol, and because of that, you want to create an illusion for the reader that a steady\nprogress toward an inevitable and exciting goal is happening in your story. You usually want to do this by identifying\nwhat your plot is going to be. What your actual story arc, not necessarily\njust your umbrella. Oftentimes, like I said, your story arc and\nyour umbrella plot are the same. But you want to know, you want to ask yourself,\nwhy are people turning the page? What question do they need answered? Now, there can be multiples. The bigger your book, the longer your story,\nthe more of these you will generally have. But there will be a few overriding ones, and\nyou usually, at least I do, you make this happen by identifying what type of plot you\nare doing. We'll talk about those in a little bit. We did an entire year on Writing Excuses,\nso if you need more, well, go listen to Season 11 is it? Elemental Genres is what it's called. All the Writing Excuses people humoring me\nas we go through kind of Brandon's philosophy on plotting. Just for the sake of discussion, I will use\nStar Wars.", "2694": " Let's use Star Wars as an example. In Star Wars, we have an umbrella plot of\ndestroy empire, which you don't really realize is the whole umbrella plot. You think it is relegated to get the plans\nto the people. There's your umbrella plot. Yeah, rescue the princess is on there. That's all kind of, yeah, get the plans to\nthe people and rescue princess. Help me Obi Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Your character arc, your main character arc,\nis Luke becomes a Jedi, or really, Luke trusts the force. Luke takes the first step on becoming a Jedi,\nis what it actually turned out to be. But the promise is, Luke's going to use the\nforce. It's going to be cool. You have a secondary character arc of Han\nbecomes not as much a jerk. That's what that says. I'm sorry. Sometimes my handwriting just kind of turns\ninto hieroglyphics. But you've got a secondary character arc of\nHan becomes not so much a jerk. I would say those are our plots. In this one, your story arc and your umbrella\narc, basically the same thing. Very simple plot. Here's your story arc. Here's your character arc. Go. Your sense of progress that you give the reader,\nor the viewer in this case, needs to snowball", "2794": " into these things. Where writers go wrong, and why their stories\ncan get boring, even though they're exciting, is when they give a promise, and then they\ngo in a different direction for their plot arc. Now, sometimes you do this intentionally. It is a very difficult thing to do, and we\ncan maybe talk about exceptions later. But let me give you a real-world example of\nthis in my own writing. I was working on Oathbringer, the third Stormlight\nbook. I'll try to avoid specific spoilers, for those\nof you who haven't read it. But in Oathbringer, at a certain point, people\nend up, a bunch of the characters end up in", "2844": " the alternate dimension, Shadesmar, which\nis kind of like a realm of fairies, maybe? How would you explain that, people that read? The fey realm? They end up in the fey realm. Something like that. They end up in an alternate dimension. Here, a big disaster has happened. They have narrowly escaped with their lives. Characters are in serious problems mentally\nand emotionally. They get together. In the original draft, they talk about what\nthey need to do, and they say, \"If we can get over to this other thing, this other place,\nthere's a portal there that takes us back to the real world, and we can start to put\nthings back on track.\" I, as an author, knew they actually needed\nto be down here for the big climax. So as they went on their way, they got diverted. They're like, well, we have to go here to\nget to this place that'll get a ship, and nope, it's going-- Oh, no! We ended up here. For the big climax. Who woulda thunk? That we end up where all the other characters\nare going. I was really looking forward to writing this\nsequence. Going to Shadesmar was something I had been\npromising in the books since the first one. I knew it was going to be very visually interesting. It was going to have some really interesting\nplot things. Some of the things the characters were going\nthrough were fascinating, to me at least as a writer. I wrote the sequence, and during beta reads\nit came back as everyone's least favorite sequence. They all thought it was boring. I'm like, \"Really? But-- but it's not boring. Why do you all think it's boring?\" I realized that I had violated this. You do it all the time as a writer. This was a mini promise within a story. But when I got them together and said, we\nare going to have a mini travelogue in the middle of our story, it's a plot archetype. See this place over here? We're going to go there. And then we went down here. And everyone, in the back of their mind, even\nif they couldn't articulate, was thinking, \"Okay, but this has to be the diversion. We're on the diversion until we get back to\nthe real plot, which is to get over here.\" They kept waiting for the diversion to end\nand got frustrated and bored with the diversion. If you've ever been in a movie where you're\nlike, \"I'm so bored, even though exciting things are happening, with these characters. Can't they just get back to the main plot?\" [Cantobyte.] It's because we weren't sold on the progress\ntoward what we wanted to have happen. We had too many different promises that we\nwere more interested in, and/or we were going about the wrong direction about having it\nhappen. So I revised the story so that up here in\nthis discussion, soon after it, they have a thing where they all get together and say,\n\"Where are we going?\" All the characters are going, \"We need to\ngo over here,\" except Kaladin, who is our primary viewpoint character saying, \"I have\nhad a vision. If we don't go here, somebody very important\nto us dies.\" They're all like, dude, you may be a little\noff your rocker. But sold the reader on the idea that this\nwas the real goal, and we need to get there. So when we got diverted, everyone who was\nreading knew, \"I knew we were supposed to go there originally.\" Suddenly, the promise became different, and\nthe gamma readers loved the sequence, just as I had been hoping that they would. This is the power of proper promises and progress\nalong those promises. I changed virtually nothing about what was\nactually happening.", "3084": " I changed the promise and the tone at the\nbeginning. Instead of \"we need to escape,\" it turned\ninto \"we need to save this person, which means we need to get there.\" Slightly different tone, slightly different\nlocational goal on our travelogue, and suddenly all the readers were on board. Now, I say all the readers. It's totally possible that some of the people\nwatching this or listening are like, \"I still hated that part, Brandon.\" That's okay. We talked about tastes earlier. What I get really worried about when I have\nbeta reads, is when a large group of readers that I thought were going to enjoy something\nfind it boring instead. That's a problem. Happened again in Starsight, actually, where\nI had to do major revisions on Starsight because my promises up front were very poorly done\nin the original draft, and I could not figure out why until I had had beta reads, and talked\nit over with editors. This is not an obvious thing sometimes. You would think, after 25 years of doing this,\nI would know, intrinsically, how to just make a good promise at the beginning. But there are two cases in my two most recent\nbooks. Now, Skyward is in the middle, and it didn't\nhave one of these. But two of my three most recent books, where\nI fundamentally misjudged a promise or a progress I was making. In both cases, the solution was to change\nthe promise, not the progress. That was because I'd already written the book,\nand I didn't want to write another one. In outlining, if I figure this out, I would\nprobably go 50:50 on whether I change the promise or if I change the progress. The idea with Star Wars is, most of the things\nthat the character should be doing should be working on these points. You should be making steps toward these three\nthings. Every scene written in Star Wars, because\nit has to be so tight, this is a film. Books can get away with a little more flabbiness,\nbut I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.", "3204": " Every scene either advances the \"let's get\nthe plans,\" \"let's rescue the princess,\" \"let's learn to trust the force.\u201d What you do as an author, if you're building\nan outline, if you want to outline, is you look at what your plot is, and you say, what\nare small increments I can make along this path that will be really interesting to the\nreader, that will show we're making progress, or occasionally backsliding. Backsliding is okay too. As long as you're very careful about how you\ndo it, backsliding can be okay now and then. Particularly if, you know, \"We're going to\ntake the plans to Alderon. Alderon isn't there anymore. That's a problem.\" We have just back slided, but there's a princess\nhere, so let's go rescue the princess. She's rich. Then you're playing on this one, Identifying\nwhat type of plot you have can be very handy for this. We don't have a ton of time left today. We have less than 15 minutes. So we may shove some of this to the next plot\ndiscussion, where I talk a lot about the different plot archetypes. But the idea is that you want to be thinking\nabout, if you have a romance or relationship plot as really the core plot of your story,\nmake sure you are indicating progress happening. If your main story is \"We need to get to Mount\nDoom,\" then each adventure you have on the way should generally take you a little bit\ncloser to Mount Doom. Q: It seems like in romance the step backs\nare more acceptable than other archetypes. I would say that in all the-- The question\nis, it seems like in romance the step backs are more acceptable than other archetypes.", "3324": " I would say generally yes. I think that's a valid observation. But I would say step backs are expected in\nalmost every story. You use the step backs, generally, in your\ntype of twist you're doing, or how you're changing the plot. Q: Because most of the step backs, like with\nthe Alderon one, it happened very quickly and then they were off doing-- It wasn't something\nthey put a lot of time towards. Right. Q: It seems like if you do a huge, I guess\nis the word for it, and then you step back, way back. Yeah. If you step way back. Q: Why am I reading all of this? Exactly. It requires some sort of fluency. For those who are watching on YouTube, the\ncomment is, seems like if you did all this work to go somewhere and then stepped all\nthe way back, it would feel really terrible in most plots. But most romance stories, readers accept that\nyou're not stepping back as far as the characters think they are, and that's a fundamental part\nof that. That, \"oh, it's all destroyed,\" the all is\nlost moment happens in almost every story. Not always. But you have this moment where, \"Oh, no. Obi Wan is dead. Ahhhh! That's bad! That's worse than a planet being blown up.\" In the context of the story, not in real life. And a lot of stories will have these sort\nof things, where for a moment you believe that you've stepped all the way back to the\nbeginning, but you haven't really. That kind of comes into your payoff and your\nplot twist. Let's talk about payoff. Actually, let's do any more questions about\nprogress before we end on payoff. Q: You said something about, when you were\ntalking about a little anecdote over here,", "3444": " so promise, progress, and payoff are all four\nsubplots as well, and you have to do it several times throughout the story, not just for--\nYeah. The question is, so this is for subplots,\nnot just for the main story. Yes. Asterisk. The longer your book, the more subplots you're\ngoing to have, and the more of these you have to set up. Like, Oathbringer is, in some ways, a terrible\nexample, because I plot Stormlight Archive books, generally, as three novels that I put\ntogether between one cover. That sequence actually was the beginning of\na new book in my plotting archetype. But because I do that, it allows me the plot\nbefore, the plot arc before was, we need to go to this city and save this city, and then\nsomething terrible happened, and we actually were able to have a major failure in a way\nthat didn't feel so disastrous. Because people can completely fail a little\nbit more easily in the middle of a story than at the end of a story. This is why Empire Strikes Back can work the\nway it does. If Return of the Jedi ended that way, it might\nbe more of a downer. Not to say you can't do that. There are certainly lots of great stories\nthat do. I was able to basically make Oathbringer a\ntrilogy. But even not doing that, you will have mini\nplot arcs and things. I often talk about, I use this idea of, what\nyou are doing, really, is you are nesting plots, like you do in code. Where it's like you've got open bracket, open\nbracket, open bracket. And these are like your umbrella. You've got your other arc, if you've got a\nseparate one. You've got your character. Then you're going to close all those three\nnear the end. Though you might not close the umbrella until\nbook 2, or book 3, with another book in between. This is very common. In here, though, you might be like, mini plot,\nmini plot, mini plot. Example from Star Wars, since we're using\nthat. Alderon was gone and we've been pulled into\nthe tractor beam. New mini plot, new side plot. Turn off the Death Star's tractor beam and\nrescue the princess for good. You already, you kind of foreshadowed the\nrescue the princess plot, but really it starts right there. We can go rescue her. Obi Wan goes and does this. You have mini plots with their own kind of\nproblems, and things like that. Then at the middle you close that bracket\nand go to the next one. This sort of visualizing a plot tends to work\nreally well. One of the things we're not talking about\ntoday that I need to remember to talk about next time is, this progress should involve\nproblems arising and things like that. But I guess we can talk about that in twists. All right, let's go on to talking about--\nOh, was there another one that I missed? Okay. Let's talk about payoff then. Payoff. Payoff is where you make good on all of this. The trick is you don't always make exactly\ngood on it. Now, your classic archetype, which is still\nperfectly valid, is to make a promise at the beginning, work hard through the progress\nto show that it's working, then have things start to fall apart, and start Act III with\nthe character thinking it's just not going to work at all. They've tried and they've failed. Then at the start of Act III, they find new\ninspiration, a new bit of information, or a new clue, or just the strength to try again,\nand then this time it works. Then it works and you get what you were promised\nat the beginning. That is totally okay. I call that, my sort of metaphor for that\nis, you promise your son you're going to buy him a toy car. He waits till Christmas, as he's supposed\nto wait. He opens his box and gets a toy car. And there's nothing wrong with that. People often read a lot of books that have\nvery twisty plots with lots of reversals and say, \"I guess I have to do that,\" forgetting\nthat a lot of the best stories out there, Star Wars is an example, don't have as much\nof a twisty plot. Star Wars has what I call the plot expansion\nas a twist. The plot expansion is, you promise your kid\na toy car, they wait really, really well, and then you give them a brand-new real car. This is the Luke Skywalker is promised \"You're\ngoing to get to go into the sky and help bring these plans back,\" and at the end it's actually,\n\"You didn't just bring the plans back. You destroyed the Death Star yourself and\nsaved the princess.\" Plot expansion. And that is a twist. Because the promise at the beginning is intentionally\nsmaller than you know you're going to deliver on, and you work hard to hook them on this. This is the twist I use for Mistborn. Surprise. Sorry, guys. But one of the big twists for Mistborn is,\nyour promise is, you're going to get a heist. As you experience the story, as our progress\ngoes through, you see how terrible life is for people here, and you start to think, \"Man,\nI do want these cool thieves to pull off their heist. But the thing is, if they just enrich themselves\nand run, they're going to leave behind all these other people, and I actually want something\nmore. I kind of wish this was Star Wars and they\nwere going to overthrow the Empire. Holy crap! They overthrew the Empire.\" I was able to do that, in part, because people\ndon't expect-- People read that book and expect, book three they fight the empire, book one\nthey pull off the heist. That was the model for epic fantasy, in a\nway. And so by doing the expansion twist, which\nis like, nope, we're going to do it all in one book, you give the reader more than they\nexpected. Very rarely do you run into trouble when you're\ndoing a plot twist, when you give the reader more than they expected. You can run into problems when you give them\nthe substitute. If you do it really well, it doesn't matter. In fact, they like it better. So the substitute plot twist to envision this\nis, you promise your son you're going to give him a toy car. You then spend several months talking about\nhow awesome toy planes are, to the point that your son says, \"Man, I wish I was getting\na toy plane.\" Then they open their box at the end and it's\na toy plane. And we're like, \"Yay! Toy plane!\" The classic example, one of the best ever\nto do this is While You Were Sleeping. If you guys haven't seen this movie. Yeah. What's that? Spoilers? You've never seen it? It's okay. It's a fantastic romance story where a woman\nsees the perfect man. She has a terrible life. She falls in love with him from afar. Then he goes into a coma, and accidentally,\nthrough hijinks, she maybe says to people she's his girlfriend. His whole family is like, \"He never tells\nus anything. Come.\" And she becomes part of the family. Then she gets in deeper to where you're like,\n\"Oh, man, I wish you hadn't promised us those two would get together.\" Because the promise at the beginning is this\nperfect man's going to be her love interest. You're like, \"This is getting worse and worse.\" In the meantime, she falls in love with his\nbrother, who is a really cool guy and is a great match for her. But the story is, of course she has to end\nup with this guy. But of course, at the end she ends up with\nthe toy plane instead. And it is a brilliant substitution plot. Substitution plot generally depends on you\nconvincing the reader that you actually want something else. I would argue, though this is a really big\noutlier, that this is what Into the Woods is. People often bring up Into the Woods and say,\n\"How do you do Into the Woods?\" If you haven't seen Into the Woods, it starts\noff as a classic set of fairy tells. At the midpoint into Act II, all these people's\nlives turn into disasters and they all die, and it's miserable. But it's fun miserable. Sondheim, everyone. Why does this work? Well, this works, when it does, a lot of people\nhate it. Let's just point this out. Substitution plots can be dangerous this way. A lot of people hate it. A lot of people like it because during the\nbeginning there's this sense that everything's too perfect. Everything's just not-- it's too perfect. Plus, it's Sondheim. When does someone get killed and be baked\ninto a pie? Then you're like, \"Yes! Everyone's getting killed and baked into pies.\" For the second half. But Into the Woods is a really strange example. We are out of time on this. But let me just end by saying, your payoff\nshould flow naturally from the type of progress you're doing, with the asterisk of if you're\ngoing to a substitution or change the plot a little bit, you do want to consider doing\nthat. But it should give them, in most cases, everything\nthey want at the beginning, plus something else and new. Your best bet is to give them a toy car and\na plane. Those are generally the best types of stories. But just make sure it follows from the progress\nthat you spend your story on, and you will be fine. We'll see you guys all next week. Thanks."}, "3": {"0": " All right, guys, let's do class. Yay! Oh,\nboy, class! The way I'm going to format the class year\nis, we will do our second week on plot this week, and then next week I'm going to dedicate\nto going through your questions that you've written on your little slips about plot or\nwhatever it is. I'll do last week's and this week's. If there are things that I don't answer\nabout plot, or things that are confusing or whatnot, or you want me to dig in deeper to,\nput them on your sheets, and those will come to me next week and we'll do a Q&A episode.\nThe week after that, I believe, Isaac can confirm, will be the week that Mary Robinette\nwill be here. Isaac: The week of the 18th.\nThe week of the 18th? Whatever the week of the 18th is, the week that Mary Robinette\nwill be here, and she is going to talk to you about short stories, I think is what we\ndecided, something she's much better at than I am.\nLet's talk more about plot. Last week we dug into this kind of my philosophy about promises,\nprogress, and payoffs. It was kind of high-level conceptual stuff. Today I want to dig into\na little bit more of the nitty gritty. How do you actually construct a plot? What are\nthe pieces that go together to make a plot work? How do you make an outline?\nNow, the caveat to this is, not everybody uses an outline. An outline is not necessary\nto write a story, even a very complex one. Generally, as we talked about the first week,\npeople do kind of fall in this spectrum between how much upfront work they want to do, and\nhow much back end work they want to do. That's really the discussion you're having when you're\ndeciding if you're more of a discovery writer or more of an outline writer, how much up-front\nwork, how much back-end work. Both have to do some up-front work, and both have to do\nsome back-end work. A discovery writer is generally offloading a lot of stuff that the\noutline writer does to the end, to do more revisions, to try and fix things that are\nbroken, whereas the outline writer tends to front load it and get a cleaner first draft.\nIf you are a discovery writer by nature and you think, why are we-- can I go to sleep\nfor this entire thing? Well, I was a student, so yes, if you need to go to sleep, go ahead.\nThese are comfy chairs, much more comfy than most classrooms.\nBut most of the time, most of the discovery writers I know, they like knowing this stuff,\nbecause this is the sort of thing you do in drafting, is you look for what is the structure\nof my plot? What are my promises? What are my payoffs? How am I making this work? In\nfact, a lot of my friends who are discovery writers, it's like their first draft is kind\nof like a really good outline. Their second draft, then, becomes the equivalent of the\noutline writer's first draft. In fact, I have a good friend who writes every book twice\nfrom scratch. Writes the book all the way through, puts it aside. Now that's her outline,\nand she starts on page one and writes every word again, using that as an outline. I think\nthat would be miserable. That's why it's good that there are different writers and there\nis no one way to do this. Because for me, doing up front work and creating an outline\nhelps me a great deal. Why do I like this? Well, I've talked to you\nguys a little bit about how, as a writer, as you progress as a writer, you learn to\ndo some things by instinct, and you then can focus on other things in your actual writing,\nhour by hour, day by day, and get better at those things. An outline works a little bit\nlike that for me, in that I can offload some of the work that I would have to be doing\nwhile I'm sitting and writing to a planning session before I start the book. Which means\nthat when I sit down to write the chapter, there are fewer things I have to keep in my\nbrain, because the chapter outline has provided some of the high-level stuff that I need to\naccomplish, and I can just focus on making this chapter exciting, making it interesting,\nmaking sure it's active rather than passive, making sure that instead of info dumps we're\nfocusing on what the characters motivations are and how I see the world. I\ndo this. We're going to talk about my method", "291": " of outlining right now first. This is just\none that works very well for me. When I was in high school or junior high or\nwhatever, they talked about outlines. They talked about an outline having a number 1,\nand then an A, and then i, and then ii, and that was what your outline looked like.\nWhen I got into writing, I assumed that's what an outline was. An outline is not necessarily\nthat. In fact, if an editor asks you to send them an outline for your story, that is just\nshorthand for about a three-page document telling them your story. It does not indicate,\nthey do not want heading 1, subheading B. If they say, \"Send me three sample chapters\nand an outline,\" it can be longer than three pages. Three to five pages is what I would\nrecommend, nothing longer than 10. Ten is getting into, like, if you are writing an\nepic fantasy, and you are working with the editor, and they've already bought the book\nand they want the outline, then they can get longer. But they upfront are just asking,\nwhat they want is a summary. Outline means summary to editors.\nNow, for me, that's not what my outline looks like either. It is not a summary. In writing\nmy books, and if we get on the ball, we will post for you guys one of my outlines, because\nI can give you the one for Steelheart or for Skyward. Because those ones are a little bit\neasier to understand than Stormlight outlines. This is in part because so many things in\nthe Stormlight outline are actually referencing to my Wiki, my internal Wiki, which is all\nmy world building, and things like that. Most of my outlines will look like this. They will\nstart with a heading for character. Then they will have a heading for setting. And then\nthey will have a heading for plot. These will each be, I will use Microsoft Word's document\nmap, and I'll make these top level of an outline. In this case it is building an outline. So\nI can easily get through the document and click to things that I want.\nThen underneath character there will be the names of each of the characters. So, you know,\nKaladin, Shalon, Dalinar, Szeth, for the main characters. Let me erase underneath and just\nkind of go a little bit more. I will give each main character their own heading, and\nthen I will have a separate heading for side characters underneath it, and then there'll\nbe some bullet points under there that are a different outline level. The character one\nis, I start out saying what is the character's arc? Under each of these characters, like\nif you went to the Kaladin one-- By the way, I'm explaining it to look way prettier than\nit actually does in the original Way of Kings outline. In Skyward it looks like you might\nbe able to understand, so I'll try to get you that one or Steelheart. But it'll say,\nunder this I'll have a paragraph that explains who they are. Then I'll have another one that's\njust kind of like, this is intro, and this is arc. That'll be like arc 1, arc 2, and\nthings like that. This will be for every character. It'll be like, this is where they're starting,\nthis is where they're going. I'll get into how I build those arcs in a minute. All right?\nI'm just giving you what it looks like. The side characters might only have one little\nparagraph about each of them. Under setting I will have large headings that will talk\nabout things like the magic or the tech, the world building, like the physical setting,\nand the cultural setting. Don't stress too much about this, because we will have two\nentire weeks talking about setting, and we'll have two entire weeks talking about character.\nI'm just giving you the format of what this looks like for me. Under there, that's going\nto read more like an encyclopedia entry. This is me defining terms for each of these. There'll\nbe subheadings if it's getting very long. I usually do split between physical setting\nand cultural setting, and we'll do a day on each of those during world building. We'll\ntalk about the differences and why I group them that way. But ignoring all of that for\nnow, let's look at plot, because today is", "603": " our plot day.\nWhen I am building my plot in an outline for a book, I am looking for a couple of things.\nOne of the main things I'm looking for are my promises, my progress, and my payoff. The\nmost important thing, generally, for me to determine is the progress part. Because once\nI understand the progress part in my outline, I can figure out the correct promises and\nhow to make good on that. When I'm doing that, I'm usually looking for some sort of plot\narchetype that I can use. By my definitions", "640": " today, a plot archetype is different from\na plot structure. Plot structure, which we'll talk about a little bit later is something\nlike three act format or the Hero\u2019s Journey. A plot archetype is a style of plot, what\nwe're trying to achieve. To explain this, I'll talk about, I'll use\nMistborn. When I was building Mistborn, there were a couple of things that made me excited\nto write the book. The first was that it was going to be a heist. This was one of my primary\nplot archetypes. A heist is a type of story. It is a story that you can go find other heist-type\nstories and learn what they did. You can research them, you can figure them out, and you can\nstart using them. I also knew, in my outlining, that there was going to be a master-apprentice\nplot, that there was going to be the story about Vin learning to because a Mistborn.\nThis is the My Fair Lady side of it. Vin trains under Kelsior to learn to move among the nobility\nand also to learn how to use allomancy. Then I also knew there was going to be what\nI'll call an information plot. This is a plot,", "729": " it's a mystery. There are certain things we\ndon't know about the Lord Ruler that are going to be teased as clues. I look at these three\nthings and I say, how do I build a story around these ideas. Oh, there's also one more. There\nis the relationship. There's a relationship, a Vin and Elend romance subplot. I think I\ngot all the main ones, looking at that. Someone asked, when I was scanning the questions,\nwhich we'll start digging into next week, they said, \"Do you use only one sort of progress\nand one sort of payoff for a book, or do you use more?\" Which is an excellent question.\nThere's your answer. Mistborn has four major ones that I was juggling. This is appropriate\nfor an epic fantasy novel. The thing is, one does kind of have to be\nmore important than the others, and as I worked on this book, I really kind of moved the heist\nkind of almost being secondary, and it was the master-apprentice plot that became the\nactual main, like if you're reading the book, most of the sense of progress you're getting\nis Vin becoming Mistborn, and that is the core. Most of the time you're spending with\nher is her going to the balls, fighting the people, learning the magics, all of these\nthings. So it's actually really a master-apprentice story that has a B plot or a sub mode that\nis a heist, that also has these kind of minor other secondary plots.\nNow, building one of these, I'm going to focus a little bit on the heist, because I want\nto talk to you about what I did to build the heist, even though I just told you it became\nthe secondary plot. What I find very useful is to see what other people have done. You\ncan create something whole cloth. Well, some people will say you can't. But you don't have\nto use one of these plot structures or even these plot archetypes. But man, it can be\nhandy to look and see what other people have done, to try and become a chef in the way\nthat I told you in the first week. Instead of just following a recipe, I want you to\nstart looking at recipes and things people have created and try to pull out what works.\nWhat I did is I went to a bunch of my favorite heist stories. I'm going to use films as examples\nbecause they are a little easier to break down the structure, because they tend to be\nmore focused than a novel does by the nature of their medium. I'm going to use, I watched\na bunch of heists, I read a bunch of heists, I mentioned a bunch of those in a previous\nweek, and I settled on there being two main archetypes for a heist. I realized there was\nwhat I'm going to call the Oceans 11, and what I'm going to call The Italian Job. Both\nof these have had very prominent remakes around the time when I was working on these books.\nWhat happened with these, I looked at them and I'm like, what makes them interesting?\nWhy do they work? Well, the Oceans 11 type plot goes like this. You gather a team. You\nusually have one newbie to explain things to. So you gather a team, you grab your newbie.\nYou then have an explain the problem. In Oceans 11, the remake, they have this thing where,\nit's Brad Pitt that's there, they're saying, \"We have to do this,\" and he's like, \"Which\nwe can't ever do.\" It might be George Clooney saying it. But it's basically they present\nthe problem with the cool cinematic methodology to them. It's like here is the casino we're\ngoing to rob. They have this thing that we'll have to beat, which we can't beat because\nit's impossible. And they have this thing we have to beat, which we can't beat because\nit's impossible. And we have this thing. And they lay out basically here's the big problem\nof what we're going to do. Then they start talking about breaking it to little pieces.\nAnd you follow the newbie, usually, along going to get all the little parts that are\ngoing to come together for your big solution. But one of the key attributes of this heist\nwas, at the end there's a piece missing that the newbie often is like, \"But what about\nthis?\" And they're like, \"Oh, we'll figure that out. You don't have to worry about that.\"\nThere's a big piece missing. You get to follow along in these little pieces as you see how\nthey're going to solve each of the problems that they had in the explain the problem plot.\nBut you've still got this lingering what's going to happen with the piece that's missing?\nEverything's going to go wrong. It creates this sense of doom and dread and inevitability.\nUntil you get to the end and the twist is they all knew how they were going to solve\nthat problem anyway. They just didn't tell the newbie so they could surprise us. At the\nending you think everything went wrong, but then they take off their masks, and lo and\nbehold they were the S.W.A.T. team all along, or something like that, and boom, we actually\nall went according to plan. You just didn't know it.\nThis is different from The Italian Job plot, which has kind of some similar attributes,\nthe gather a team, explain problem. But this style of heist did something really interesting\nthat I found. They introduced problem A, problem B, problems A, B, C, and D. They said, \"We\nare going to solve them with solutions 1, 2, 3, and 4. You follow the plot kind of the\nsame way. Except at the end, they get to the ending and they find out that instead of problems\nA, B, C, and D, they have problems E, F, G, and H. You've probably seen heists like this.\nThey do all the planning. They do all their preparation. They're ready to go, and then\nthey move the target. It goes to another country, or something like that. Suddenly all this\npreparation is out the window. We talked about this a little bit last week\nin the pull the rug out from underneath-- No, it wasn't to you guys. It was to someone\nelse. Never mind. I told someone, they asked me what do I do if I want to pull the rug\nout from underneath people. This is a great way to do that, because the way that they\nsolve this, do you guys know? Have you guys seen this movie? What do they do? They don't.\nExactly. They take solution one and they say, \"Wow. If we jury-rig this thing, we can solve\nproblem F with that. And number 4, the person that we've recruited specifically to crack\nthe safe can actually break into this car that we can use. And suddenly we'll use 2\nfor E and 3 for H.\" What happens is you get a jumbling up of all the preparations solving\nthe problems in different and unexpected ways. Why this works so well is, oftentimes if you\nwant to have a cool twist in your story and you pull the rug out from underneath people,\nit's a little bit like I said last week, promising someone a car and giving them something else\ncompletely different that they're not expecting. In addition, in your storytelling, your reader\nwill invest time in the middle, in your progress. They'll spend most of the time in the book\nfocusing on the things the characters are doing to progress the story. So if you built\na heist where you made 1, 2, 3, and 4 completely irrelevant now, that is 80% of the reader's\nexperience in the story getting thrown out the window, and they will feel annoyed at\nyou. They will be frustrated because you promised them something. You were also probably promising\nthem a twist if you're doing a heist, because heists architect kind of about twists. But\nyou have also upended them. How do you solve this? You make sure that\nthe time they spent on 1, 2, 3, and 4 is still very relevant by applying it on the fly to\nsolve new problems, which suddenly becomes very satisfying because you both get a twist,\nplus you feel like your expertise, the amount of time you as a reader spent experiencing\nthe story, came together at the ending. Breaking this down, let me ask you guys. Thinking about\nas a chef, why is a heist satisfying? Why", "1284": " do people want to watch a heist? Why do they\nenjoy a heist? It doesn't have to even do with the things I mentioned up here, because\nthere are pieces I haven't even mentioned that are relevant. What to you? What makes\nit work? Yeah?\nStudent: The thrill of getting away with it. The thrill of getting away with it. Exactly.\nFor a lot of great heists, even a heist where the good guys, the heroes are actually on\nthe side of law, there's a sense of, we actually got away with it. We robbed Hitler, or something\nlike that. Yeah, there's definitely a sense of that.\nYeah?", "1318": " Student: Hypercompetent characters.\nHypercompetent characters. We will speak in the character week about how competence is\nsomething really attractive to readers. Student: The puzzle of figuring out how to\ndo it. Yeah, the puzzle. Both of these leave you\nwith a puzzle. One of them leaves you with the \"we have to improvise,\" which tends to\nwork better if you have a lot of viewpoint characters in charge, because you don't have\nto hide things from them. You can cheat and hide things from people. Because I used more\nof an Oceans 11 style for Mistborn, if you were following these things. I put a little\nbit of an Italian Job twist at the end, but mostly it was Kelsior is hiding things from\neverybody, and he's a viewpoint character. You have to cheat a little bit to do that.\nGo head. Student: The feeling of rebellion. They're\na little bit rebellious or sneaky. They're sticking it to the man.\nExactly. You're getting away with something. You're doing something cool that's outside\nthe rules. Even, again, if the protagonists are heroes, it's like the Mission Impossible\nteam. No one else could do this because these people can break the rules and go outside\nwhat everyone else expects and pull off something incredible.\nStudent: We also love to see people succeed at something impossible.\nWe do. We really do. This is why there's that scene with George Clooney and Brad Pitt being\nlike, \"We have to do this, which is impossible, and this, which we'll never be able to do,\"\nbecause it sets this expectation, this promise to you. And that is, this is going to be cool\nto see them pull this off, because it's going to be hard but they're going to do it. That\nscene is a promise. It's a really cool promise. Yeah?\nStudent: Because stealing something from the dragon, I guess, is ontologically very, or\nat least we get the same feelings from that as we-- our lives are part heist movies. Our\nlives are like, everything, this whole plot line is about how we have to confront problems\nin the real world with the tools that we have available. We don't know how we're going to\nmake it out and we're going to the unknown. It's just something that's very meaningful\nand important because it's real. Right. So my recommendation to you is, when\nyou're doing this, when you're breaking down a plot, one of the things I would recommend\nyou do is ask yourself these questions. Why do people love this? Why do I love this? Why\ndo I really like taking one of these plots and watching them or playing with them? What\nare the elements I have to make sure I don't get rid of? Hyper competence. You could make\na heist without hyper competence. It would be a different type of story. But if what\nyou love about them is that hyper competence, lean into that and make sure you're making\nuse of that in order to tell your story. One of the cool things about starting to look\nat plots like this is also you can strip a plot down to its archetype, and you can apply\nthe genre trappings to it. It's really interesting. I've done all this, and then I had a chance\nto talk with Joe Russo, who is one of the filmmakers, one of the directors who made\nInfinity War. I asked him, I said, \"Joe, how", "1499": " did you build the plot of Infinity War?\"\nHe said, \"Oh, it's really cool. Not a lot of people understand what it is, but we just\ntook a heist.\" For them it was a bash and grab, which is actually a third archetype\nI didn't even put up on here. \"And we said, we're going to do a superhero movie that's\na heist, and we're going to plot it like this and apply it to superhero sci-fi. And people\nwill love it because they love a heist, but they also won't look at it and see a heist\nbecause they'll see a superhero story.\" I'm like, \"That's really interesting. Tell\nme more about how you did that because it looked really like what I'd like to do.\" And\nindeed it is, I don't think, that uncommon for storytellers to say let's take what works\nreally well in this genre and let's apply other trappings to it so that I have a familiar\nframework. I've talked a lot about the underdog sports\nstory as an archetype. Because the underdog sports story is a fun one to point out that\nHoosiers, Ender's Game, and The Way of Kings all use the underdog sports story plot archetype\nas a major section of their story. But these are three really different stories, aren't\nthey? Remember the Titans versus Ender's Game, you'd be like, oh, completely different genres\nbut they have the same plot archetype, which is the underdog sports story. Being able to\nlook at these and strip them down also helps you understand your progress.\nThis is where you can go wrong sometimes. If you're writing a fantasy novel, and you're\nlike, well, fantasy novels are travelogues. Let's say you've only read some quest fantasies\nthat you really like. You're like, it has to be a travelogue. So I'm going to make my\nsense of progress going from city to city to city. But really what you want to tell\nis a romance between two characters, and that's the bulk of the time you're going to spend\non your pages focusing on this relationship, and the relationship is not making any progress,\nit doesn't matter where you're going. The reader's going to feel bored. They're going\nto feel like nothing's happening, because the bulk of what you're giving them is a relationship\nplot without progress. What you want to be able to identify is what\nare your steps. Now, a heist is kind of interesting in this way, because your steps are generally,\nyou have the explain the problem, it actually gives the reader an outline. Like, here is\nthe outline of what our story is going to be. We have these 12 problems and we're going\nto attack them one at a time. Then your sense of progress is as you go to piece by piece\nby piece and see them accomplishing or failing and having to go do something new because\none of their pieces didn't work. It has a pretty easy, straightforward structure of,\nif you're checking things off that list and coming closer and closer to be able to pull\noff the heist, the reader's anticipation for that heist will grow. They will know something's\ngot to go wrong, because it always does. You'll probably put seeds in by saying, \"Well, there's\nthis one thing we haven't figured out yet,\" or by saying, \"Everything's great. We're ready\nto go tomorrow. Oh, no, they moved the target.\" You will be able to build this tension through\nprogress, progress, progress, progress. Once you identify that, it makes your promise\nscene much easier to write. Your promise scene in a heist is this one right here. You do\nnot have to do it exactly as they did it. In fact, I recommend that you don't. But you'll\nsee how that promise works really well, and then your payoff at the end is them pulling\noff the heist despite the problems that came along the way. Very simple, very straightforward.\nIt is harder to do than say. Let's look at some other styles of plots and\nsome of the progress we can have in those, and how those payoffs can match their promises\nin the beginning. Let's start with a mystery. We've got a classic detective mystery, who-done-it\nmurder mystery. Why do we enjoy murder mysteries? Anyone who does? Go ahead.\nStudent: They're clever. They're clever. Okay. There's an implicit\npromise that the detective is going to be smarter than the villain. That's what we're\nlooking at. Yeah?\nStudent: The puzzle aspect again. We want to figure out what happened.\nWe want to know what happened. We want to know how they did it. Unless the reversal\nis they show you how they did it, and then you're going to see-- like was that Columbo,\nwhere they reversed, they inverted the trope? Yeah.\nStudent: Sometimes it's a puzzle for you, the challenge of, can I figure this out before\nSherlock Holmes does? Yep. That, I think, is a major draw of mysteries.\nCan I figure it out? Let me highlight that one for a minute, because mysteries, if you\ncheat, and the reader couldn't have figured it out, a lot of times it will feel very unsatisfying\nfor this reason. People are not understanding, writers are not understanding that part of\nthe promise of a mystery is you will be able to figure this out. If you are laying the\nclues, it's not going to be so out there. If you've read or watched a mystery that was\nreally unsatisfying to you at the ending, it might have been because they promised,\nooo, with these clues of information you could solve this crime, and then there was no way\nfor you to come anywhere close. You feel cheated at the end.\nStudent: I like the possibility of having very witty characters with really great dialogue\nto bounce off each other as the investigator tries to decipher [___].\nRight. That tends to be a hallmark of the detective-driven murder mystery, is you're\ngoing to like the detective. It might be because they're witty. It might just be because they're\nfolksy, and they're more Agatha Christy. You're just going to enjoy-- Not Agatha Christy,\nAngela Lansbury. They're going to be Angela Lansbury. You're just going to enjoy watching\nher solve a mystery because she's just so likeable that there's going to be a connection\nto the detective. In Agatha Christy, it often was about how clever the detective was.\nGo ahead. Yeah. Student: I think one of the things I like\nabout mysteries is the misdirection. You can still figure it out.\nRight. You don't go from point A all the way to,\nokay, okay, I think this is where it's going. Instead it'll be like, I didn't see that,\nbut now I can see where that's coming from. Right. A mystery implies that there is going\nto be some difficulty to this, and there are going to be new revelations. I identify a\nmystery as an information plot. A mystery is, characters don't have all the information,\nand the progress is watching the characters get that information as you try to put together\nwhat that information means. Spoiler, in Mistborn it is the true history of the Lord Ruler.\nI won't say what it is. But the true history of the Lord Ruler, the book lies to you at\nthe beginning, and then indicates that the story is a lie that you've been told, gives\nyou clues along the way, and then the mystery comes together at the end of understanding\nit. Now, what is really fun to do is, in Mistborn\nthe missing piece is not something Kelsior knows 100%. It is the information plot. If\nwe can put together the information plot, we can solve the missing piece of the heist\nthat Kelsior is confident he can do but doesn't quite have all the pieces yet. I was able\nto slot that information plot into this big problem in the plan as presented.\nBut relationships, why do we like--? By the way, usually a buddy cop movie and a Jane\nAusten novel follow about the same plot archetype. Just with some different trappings and subplots.\nA lot of classic romances and classic buddy cop movies are just relationship plots. Whether\nit's a bromance or a romance, it tends to follow the same plot beat. What's exciting\nfor us about a romance? Why are we reading a romance? Why do writers put them in almost\nevery story? Student: It gives poor guys like me hope.\nWish fulfillment. Yes. Wish fulfillment. Do not discount the power of wish fulfillment,\nin all kinds of plots. What else? Student: It's very humanly relatable. We can't\nrelate to superheroes to the degree that we can relate to someone who's in love.\nRight. Absolutely. I think you nailed it. It is one of these plots that you can put\ninto the most fantastical and strange of stories to give it a really powerful human element.\nStudent: I think it shares something with mysteries in that you know the mystery is\ngoing to be solved. You know the two people are going to get together, because you figure\nit out before it happens. Right. They are generally going to get together,\nbut how? The how is really exciting and interesting to us. We have two romance writers right over\nhere. Do you guys have anything to add? Student: I was going to say for old people\nit's nice to remember how it used to feel. Nice to remember how it used to feel. That\nis also pretty awesome. We're going to have these two ladies talk to us one of the weeks\nabout indie publishing, because both of them have indie published a number of books. So\nlook forward to that on how we're going to do that.\nI don't want to spend a ton of time on this. Sometimes we get up on the board and we start\nbreaking these all down and we spend a long time on it. I think I did it in a previous\nlecture series, so you can watch that on YouTube. But I think you guys get the idea. Identifying\nthe why, why we like this, and then figuring out how you can quantify that, how you can\nbreak it down into small steps, is how you build a lot of outlines. Not the only way,\nbut how it works really well. This is where we get to how does Brandon make\nan outline. My outline looks like this. It", "2117": " starts with, at the top, what I want to have\nhappen. Relationship. Character A and B are a couple at the end. I will define what that\nis based on the story. That might just be they have gotten over their issues of hating\neach other and are now willing to work together. Whatever it is, I've identified what I want\nto happen. I outline backward. I start with my goal.\nBecause once I've identified what makes something satisfying, I come up with-- what progress\nmakes it satisfying? I'm like what is the best ending for this story with that plot\narchetype? What is going to work? What is going to be exciting? Then I'm going to add\nunderneath this bullet points of all the steps that will take them from the beginning of\nthat to the end. Generally, there'll be a paragraph at the top with the relationship.\nIt's like, here's what I want to achieve. These two characters start here. They get\nhere. Here are all the things I need to include to make sure that happens. It would generally\nbe, depending on the plot that I'm doing, like bullet point 1 would be \"Scene showing\nhow character 1 is really competent in one area and is living the life, but has a need,\nhas something that they are missing.\" Then character 2, we'll show how they are capable\nin their life in some areas, but they are missing something different. The astute reader\nwill notice, hey, what this person is good at is where this person's hole is, and where\nthis person's hole is, this person has some strength. Then you will want to introduce\nwhy they don't just immediately propose to one another the first time they meet. What\nis going to be the conflict that is pulling them apart? Well, one's a Montague and one's\na-- Class: Capulet.\nYeah, that. What is going to be pulling them apart? Then I'm going to create-- I'm not\ngoing to actually create the scene. I'm going to say, \"Scene where they are working together.\"\nDave, when he taught this class, talked about relationship plots as braiding roses. Because\neverybody has thorns. At the start of the story your thorns just smash into each other.\nYour relationship plot could go with, the first time they meet it's a disaster for this\nreason. Second time they meet, it's a disaster for this reason. But then you have a scene\nwhere you realize that what character A does character B needs, and another scene where\ncharacter B realizes, \"Wow. What character A is doing here is something that I admire.\"\nYou slowly, as Dave put it, you braid those roses, so that by the end of the story instead\nof the thorns pointing at each other, they are pointing outward toward anyone who could\ncome in and try to destroy the relationship, which is a really great metaphor, which is\nwhy it stuck with me for 20 years. Braid those roses.\nYou would come up with all of these things, and they are just bullet points. They are\nnot scenes yet. They are, character A sees character B with his little sister and realizes\nthat there's a deep caring for other people that he doesn't often express because of whatever.\nYou're like, wow, that's an admirable attribute about him. I am interested. I don't know what\nthat interaction with the sister is going to be. I just know the sister is relevant.\nI have all of these bullet points. Then I jump over to the next one.\nIt's like, now we're going to do our my-- I'm going to say, all right, underneath here--\nI guess I didn't circle it before. I put, like, underneath here I'm like discover X,\nand explain why discovering X is going to be awesome. I want that end scene to be really,\nreally cool. When Raoden puts together why the magic is broken, X happens, which is a\nvery dramatic and powerful scene, because Raoden's plot is half mystery in Elantris,\nand that's kind of the plot structure I was using. Though I didn't know how to do all\nof this back then. I just kind of went with my gut. Discover X, and this is the scene\nthat's going to happen. This is how I do it. And then, how do I earn that scene. Well,\nhere, instead of all the other things, these are going to be clues that are going to be\ndiscovered, that are going to interlock with the other clues, or sometimes be red herrings\nthat you later on discover weren't doing what you thought they would do. This is how I develop\nmy sense of progress, bullet point to bullet point to bullet point, slow and steady quantified.\nI'll do this for every plot cycle in the book, and generally for every kind of character\narc, once I've determined the character arcs, what they're going to be.\nMy outline is generally, at this point, not in order. It is an order by section. Then,\nas I start writing, I start grabbing bullet points from different headings and saying,\nchapter 1 is going to be this bullet point and this bullet point. Chapter 2 is from a\ndifferent plot archetype bullet point and this one. And I start organizing those bullet\npoints. This is where, when we give you the Skyward outline, you'll be like, you'll go\nto the end and you'll probably see that a lot of these bullet points have been moved\ninto order, into a whole sequence of arcs and plots. That I am doing while I'm writing.\nI am changing this. I've got the bullet points all done. I usually start writing, and then\nI'm building a full outline of the bullet points in order chronologically, not just\nby plot archetype, but together, and I'm building scenes out of them as I imagine where they're\ngoing to be. But at the beginning of the day when I sit\ndown to write, oftentimes it's like, you need to write a scene that achieves A, B, and C,\nwhich is way easier for me than trying to keep a whole plot in my head and try to write\nso that that plot works. Instead I can be like, oh, today I just have to do this. Today\nI have to write a Navani scene where she does X, Y, and then encounters Z. I can do that.\nNow let's focus on making that scene active, interesting, it's taking place in an interesting\nsetting, having some good, dynamic conflict to the scene. I can use those bullet points\nto launch me into a great chapter. This works for me because, again, it lets me offload\na bunch of stuff to the beginning. Any questions about that? Go ahead.\nStudent: Do you necessarily have to have multiple plot archetypes so they're intertwining with\none another? Or is that mostly just for epic fantasy [___]?\nExcellent question. Do you have to have multiple", "2567": " plot archetypes that you're intertwining together,\nor is that just something for epic fantasy? The answer is, the shorter the piece you're\nwriting, the fewer of these you're usually going to have, and the longer the piece you're\nwriting, the more of them you're going to have. It is not a 1:1 correlation. There are\nsome very long stories that are plotted more", "2583": " as a series of explosions that the character\nis dealing with, and the book ends just when there's not another explosion. Nothing goes\nwrong this time. It feels more discovery written that way. It works really well. We'll talk\nabout it under discovery plotting. But most of the time, for a novel, you're\ngenerally going to want at least one plot archetype, at least one character arc, and\nat least one sort of subplot archetype, either a relationship or a master-apprentice or something\nlike that. I would say that's what you're looking at most of the time. For Skyward,\nwhich is much less complex, for Skyward I was using the boy-finds-a-dragon-egg plot\narchetype. I don't know if you could find that one in books on plots, but it's one I\nnoticed. I read a lot of great books. I'm like, I'm going to use a boy and his dragon\negg, except it's going to be a girl finds a spaceship. The archetype is kid finds some\ncool thing, keeps it secret, works on it. That was the main plot that I was doing.\nBut I had a secondary relationship plot going on, and I had a tertiary. I had a character\narc for her. If you haven't read the book, Spensa's got this kind of, these ideals of\nwhat a hero should be, and then actually goes to war and has to deal with her idealized\npicture of heroism not meshing very well with how it is to actually be fighting, and that's\nher character arc. Those are the three ones. There's a couple minor things, but I would\nsay that's the three. There is a relationship with the ship she finds, but that's kind of\nbuilt into the kid and the dragon egg story. You can see that one is simpler than Way of\nKings, which has a ton of these things. Like, the Way of Kings plots don't fit in a file\nbecause I have all this world building and things. They are crazy. One thing I do like\nto do with Way of Kings, though, is make sure that every book has one very relatable plot\narchetype, because the other plots are generally not following one. This is why Kaladin having\nthe underdog sports story is so important to the Way of Kings, because it could feel\nlike a jumble of a whole bunch of things going on. Because Dalinar's plot is not as simple\nand as clear-cut an archetypal plot. Shalon's is a little bit more. But there's so much\ngoing on that if you don't have that one sturdy central plot to hold on to, then it makes\nthe book feel-- it would make it feel just crazy. That's where Way of Kings, the first\nversion I wrote in 2002, went wrong, is it didn't have this. It had one section of a\nbunch of different plots, but it didn't finish any of them.\nAnyway, there was a question back here. Yeah, go ahead.\nStudent: Yeah, so quick question. How do you keep this fresh? Especially like, I know that\ngood writing will make anything interesting. Right.\nStudent: But maybe when you're pitching it to someone?\nHow do you make this fresh, adding the caveat that you know that good writing will make\nanything interesting, but how to you keep it fresh when you're pitching it? This is\nwhere the strange attractor I talked about comes in really handy. When you can pitch--\nwhen you can say, \"It's the story of a boy", "2781": " and his dragon, except it's a girl and a spaceship.\"\nSuddenly it adds-- you're telling people what the new fresh take on it is.\nThat's actually a very small part of what makes Skyward work. What makes Skyward work,\nI hope, is a really great execution of this plot, with a character arc that feels really\npersonal and poignant. That's what's going to make any book work. But what hooks people\nis saying, \"Oh yeah, the hero who was prophesied to save the world failed, and now a bunch\nof people are going to rob it.\" They're like, \"Ooo, tell me more!\" This is where pitching\nbecomes an art of its own. Because really, the pitch is a way to get people to read the\nbook and see that it works and is good, but it has to, you usually want to pitch with\none idea. We'll talk more about pitching as the semester progresses. But, yeah. Focus\non one really distinctive thing in your pitching, and that's like simply doing another heist\nbut adding on an interesting magic you've come up with and a character who's interesting,\ngenerally going to be great. I often say, plot and character, it's a little\nharder to be really different. Because-- actually, it's really easy to be really different. It's\njust unsatisfying. There's a reason that certain plots are done. There's a reason that certain\ncharacters are done. That is, you can look at the modernist literary movement and antiheroes,\nlike in the classical sense, like Madame Bovary, and things like this, and trying to write\nthese antiheroes that are just miserable to read about. But there's a reason why popular\nfiction in particular tends to go back to the same sorts of stories, because they work\nreal well. It's the distinctive flair you put on it that's going to make it work.\nSetting is where you can go just crazy, as long as your character is relatable, and it\ndoesn't matter. You see that in modern animation. Like, if you think about it, trying to tell\nstories about, what is that famous Pixar thing? They're like, we're going to start and writer\ngoing to make it like bugs have feelings. And then we're going to make toys have feelings.\nAnd now feelings have feelings. Right? But because you can make relatable characters,\nyou can have a story take place inside a tween girl's mind, with personifications of her\nemotional states, and have it work. Because setting is way easier to go crazy on than\nplot and character. Oh, wait, there was a-- Yeah, go ahead.\nStudent: You talk about mixing archetypes in one story, having more than one. But what\nif you have the same one, but duplicate it? Can you do the same plot duplicated in the\nsame story? Yes, you can. I would have them play out in slightly different ways. Like,\nyou can have two relationships and have the way that one is going sour as a contrast to\nthe way that one is going well. Pride and Prejudice, folks. And do the reversal, where\nyou think the one that is going well turns very terribly, and they think the one that's\ngoing poorly turns out really well. That is the reversal that makes Pride and Prejudice\nso cool. It's the same two plots, just an A plot and a B plot.\nStudent: I guess I ask in terms of, like, you say that in conflict you've got to have\nlength, you need to have more of these plot lines, and so you could have more of the same\nones. You could have more of the same ones to make\na story longer. If you want to make a story longer, more steps is also a way. If you wanted\nto make a heist longer, what you'd do is you'd be like, writer going to have to break this\nup into three mini heists, which is very common for these, and this whole section is on stealing\nthis one thing that will let us later on steal this other thing. And you do three mini heists,\nfollowed by a big heist at the end, using the pieces that you've stolen. You just make\nsure each of those mini heists has a different flare, a different feeling. This is kind of,\nyou see this a big like in Inception, which is doing mini heists leading to a big heist\nat the end that goes crazy. Other questions? Yes.\nStudent: You talk about balancing these three or four or more different things. If you're\ntrying to balance different things, how do you keep them going so that one doesn't just\ndrop out for the whole novel? All right. If you're doing a whole bunch of\ndifferent things, how do you make sure one doesn't just drop out and vanish, and when\nyou come back to it they're no longer interested in it or have forgotten about it. This gets\nmore and more difficult the longer your story is, and the more of these you're juggling.\nYou're going to have to come to your own decisions on what you want to do here.\nThere is the, what I'll fondly call the Robert Jordan. The Robert Jordan method is to basically\nbreak your plot into sections, and then you will get, you'll be like, all right, there's\nkind of a mini climax here. We're going to do these parts of the relationship, and then\nwriter going to skip a book, and then you'll come back to it. I'm going to try to get you\nto a part where this is satisfying enough for now. Or, if it's a big cliffhanger, you\nonly have to remember one thing, because we're going to jump a big time gap before we get\nback to it. This is where epic fantasy often has to go.\nBut there is also the method of do them one at a time. Be like, all right, opening part\nof this big, long book, we are going to focus on the relationship. But then the characters\nare going to be split apart and pining for each other for the next part where they are\nsplit apart, because they've only just had their relationship start to work, and now\nthey get ripped apart. Then that, you only have to keep in your mind one thing. If you\nare-- most of the time I have found that you can interweave these and not have to do this\ntoo much. A lot of what I do in the Stormlight is kind\nof a hybrid of these two. Way of Kings is a good example. I take Shalon's plot to a\nstopping point, and then I skip a part and", "3163": " we do Dalinar's plot for a while, and then\nI skip back. I try to make sure you're getting conclusions to both of them in the same book,\nand that Kaladin in that first book acts as a through line. I make sure they're, Dalinar\nand Shalon's plots are short enough that you can do them in half of a book instead of a\nwhole book. And then I try to weave them together like that. It is a real difficulty. It takes\npractice. This is why doing a little work ahead of time and realizing, oh, man, I'm\ngoing to have this huge gap where the characters aren't together. Maybe I should have the big\nmoment in their relationship happen up here where they break up, because they're going\nto be apart from one another, rather than having it be in the middle of their story.\nAll right. We'll do one last one and then we'll move on. Yeah?\nStudent: What does your plot brainstorming session look like? Do you just look for things\nyou like and write them all down? The question is, what does my plot brainstorming\nlook like? Do I just look for a lot of things and then write them all down? Kind of. Like,\na lot of times these are simmering for a long time. I'm going to the gym, I'm working out,\nand I'm imagining what that last scene is. Like, the last scenes of a given plot are\nwhat is going through my head many times before I can sit down to make this thing. But, when\nI'm making this thing, I am generally just saying, all right, here is the plot archetype\nthat I'm using. Here are important elements to it. Which of those do I want to use? That's\nan important thing that'll segue us into the next thing I want to talk about is some of\nthese plot structures. Now, I'm only going to pick a couple of them\nand talk about how you would apply them. Because there are a ton of these helps out there,\nand they all can be really helpful, or they can just be useless to you. It depends on\nif they work for you. But you can buy books. You can buy Save the Cat, which is a screenwriting\nbook that's talking a lot about establishing reading interest and how to plot a story.\nYou can read many different books. There's a nine-point story structure. There's a seven-point\nstory structure. Dan really likes one of those two. I can't remember which one it is. But\nhe's got a great YouTube video on it. Is it seven? It's seven, isn't it? Yeah, he has\na great YouTube video on seven-point story structure. Dan Wells, writer. Everybody uses\ndifferent things. There are a couple of classics, and one of\nthem is, in science fiction and fantasy, the Hero\u2019s Journey. We'll go through it very\nshortly. You guys probably all know this. If you don't, a brief history of it is that\na guy named James Campbell was a researcher, an ethnographer, and a folklorist, and was\nresearching different stories that different people told themselves. He wasn't the first\nto come up with this, but he kind of popularized the idea that a lot of different cultures\nacross cultural barriers, language barriers, whatever, were telling the same sorts of stories.\nHe called this the monomyth, the story that-- He said, he's like all stories align to this.\nNo they don't. But a lot of stories do, because it's got a very vague structure that has a\nlot of cool elements to it. The monomyth is you have a character at home who doesn't want\nto go on an adventure. They get called on an adventure. They refuse the call. And then\nthey are Forced to go out and cross the threshold into the world. All right? What's that?\nStudent: To the unknown. To the unknown. Yeah, to the unknown. Out\nto the unknown to the character. The classic example of this is Star Wars, because Luke\nis really like the monomyth. He likes it a little too much sometimes. But he really likes,\nhe has actually some really good, there were PBS specials about the monomyth that I think\nGeorge Lucas himself did. But, yes. Luke is at home. You see the call. He looks up in\nthe sky. But then when the call-- you see he wants to go. But then when the call actually\ncomes and everyone says, \"You must learn the ways of the Jedi,\" what does he do? He's like,\n\"No, I've got to go back home and deal with power converters and stuff.\" No, I can't,\nI can't, I can't. Then he goes home and what happens? There is no home anymore. Only Storm\nTroopers are so precise, or whatever. So he's forced to go out into the unknown world. Then\nthey have the trials. This is the road of tribulation, or whatever it's called. Basically,\nproblems are popping up, and the character is learning to overcome them.\nUsually there's a mentor. And then there's not a mentor. Whoop, whoop. No-o-o-o! Usually\nyou get some buddies who will suspiciously not be around anymore by the time you get\nto the bottom of this, which is the descent in the underworld, which is where the character\neither metaphorically or literally dies and is sent to the underworld. Metaphorically,\nthey're at their lowest point. Everything's going terribly. But then they come out of\nit. They have the-- what's it called? There's the moment of apotheosis and redemption. They\ncall it something else. Campbell calls it something else. What's that? There's rebirth,\ndefinitely. Atonement, that's what it is. Basically, the character's going to change\nin some way, make some decision, learn some new skill, make atonement. They're going to\nget rewarded with the elixir. Then they're going to go home with it and take the elixir\nback. There's generally an apotheosis here, where it's like a meeting with divinity or\nwith one's father figure, and kind of accepting and dealing with that, taking the elixir,\nand heading home changed, bringing the elixir back to the people at home, but having been\nchanged so much that the hero is no longer the person who can stay home. Often there's\nan epilogue where they just wander off. Fallout, right? Was that Fallout One? That was Fallout\nOne, wasn't it? Is this useful? Yes, it is. It's really useful\nfor envisioning a character arc in an interesting way. It's really handy. I would recommend\nreading about the Hero\u2019s Journey. Where can it go wrong? Well, there are a lot of\nthings in the Hero\u2019s Journey that don't match every story. For instance, Campbell\nidentified that the hero in the ancient myths was almost always the result of a divine birth\nor a virgin birth. In the old Greek myths, Zeus was doing something, there was a really\npretty swan or whatever, and there is often this child of divinity or child that was born\nout of mysterious circumstances. So what did he add into episode one? Where did Darth Vader\ncome from? He was a virgin birth, born of the Force. Every single person in that movie\ntheater when I was there was like, \"What? Like this is cool, but what?\" If I'm going\nto criticize one of the greatest and most successful storymakers of all time in George\nLucas, which he really is, that is what I consider one of the dangers of being too slavish\nto a formula or a plot structure. This is where it gets different from an archetype.\nThe plot archetypes are like, I want to achieve this emotion in my readers, and here are some\nsteps to get that emotion. Structure is, all right, here's how I actually structure my\nstory. And if these are too rigid, you will end up putting things into your story that\njust don't feel like they fit. They generally will not ruin your story. But once in a while,\npeople can be too slavish, I feel, to following one of these plot structures.\nHow would you use the Hero\u2019s Journey? Well, looking at this and asking yourself as a chef,\nwhy do we enjoy this story? Well, there can be lots of answers, and we're down to 10 minutes,\nso I'm not going to go to questions on this one. But we can talk about the idea that all\nhuman beings kind of have to go through this. It's the story of being a teenager in a lot\nof ways, and arriving at adulthood, hopefully about the literal death and rebirth. But it\nis this thing where we are going to go through all of our lives, and we have to\u2014\nI have a 12-year-old. I'm like, \"You're going to go to college, not too much further by\nadult times, six years or so.\" He's like, \"I can't do that. I cannot move\nout.\" I'm like, \"You don't have to. You're 12. 12-year-olds\ndon't move out.\u201d But to him, this is the most terrifying thing\nthat he ever learned, is that he is going to be someday expected to leave the house\nand live on his own. That is really scary to a lot of people. We go through this.\nWhy else is it cool? Well, it's really satisfying. Like this moment. It's full of satisfying\nmoments, right? This moment is satisfying because you can usually see the hero wants\nto go on the adventure, and then they're Forced to. That moment is kind of cool. The moment\nwhere they go into the underworld, where they're at their darkest point, and they pull out\nof it anyway, is really satisfying. The apotheosis and atonement, where kind of coming to face\none's destiny, one's parental figures, to make amends for the things that they've done,\nand then return home a better person, having brought something that helps everyone else,\nwhether it's having destroyed a Death Star or not, coming home victorious is really satisfying.\nThis explains a lot of really satisfying small steps you can take, and that makes progress\nreally exciting. When the small steps of progress, on their own, give people cold chills, then\nyou're doing the right thing. Then your book is coming together. The Hero's Journey is\njust all about those moments, those triumphant moments, or those moments that are really\nrelatable, and it's why it makes such a good plot structure.\nAnother one that you guys may have run across is Three Act format, which is kind of just\na remix on the same ideas as most plot archetypes are. Three Act format imagines a story as\nthree acts with two major division points, the first one being generally where the character\nbecomes proactive. Now, you can find a lot on Three Act format. I'll just say, if I'm\nnot writing the one you know, it's okay. There are lots of different ways. But one is the\nchange from inactive to proactive. This is the moment where you go from Act I to Act\nII, where the character says, \"I will go do this.\" And everybody argues on where the different\nact breaks are, which is how you can tell this is a little more squishy than people\npretend. Everyone, again, usually uses Star Wars as\na perfect example of this, but they will disagree on whether Act I ends when Luke decides to\ngo with Obi Wan because he has no other choice, or when they get off of Tatooine, or when\nthey get on the Death Star and decide to go save the princess. All are legitimate arguments\nfor the end of Act I. You usually have a transition between Act\nII and Act III where you're at the low point, where all the things you have tried thus far\nhave just dug you deeper. And the way you do the middle is you have, generally there's\na mid-point twist, where the stakes change in some dramatic way, usually an expansion\nof the stakes, or the villain's achieved something. Generally through here you have this rising\naction where you increase stakes, increase tension, and the character tries things, and\noftentimes fails spectacularly. This is what we try a try-fail cycle, is how\nDave liked to put it. The character has come up with a solution to their problem. They\ntry it, they fail, and it gets worse. They try it again, they fail, and it gets worse.\nThey try it again, they fail, and it gets worse. And now we're at our low point because\nwe've tried everything. Oh, no, what are we going to do? Frodo has decided to keep the\nring. Spoilers, right? Yeah. Seventy years old, is it now? Some spoilers. Sixty years\nold? But, yeah. We are at a moment of utter crisis, and then the ending happens, and very\nsoon after, woo, end, and then denouement. This can be really handy, again, to structure\nyour story if you know you need to have a moment where your character takes initiative.\nYou need to have something right about the middle point of your story where the stakes\nchange in a dramatic and different way, and that needs to lead into a low point where\neverything has been tried, but there is still one chance. If Luke trusts in the Force he\ncan fire the torpedoes, even though the last ones missed, because he has the Force.\nYou can bring in, when it works really well, your overlapping different plots. For instance,\nStar Wars has Han's mini plot of an arc of will Han be a good guy or not? Is he going\nto learn to want something more than money? Lo and behold, what happens is you overlap\nthe lowest moment, Luke finally deciding to finally trust the Force, Obi Wan speaking,\nand Han returning all at once, and it becomes this really beautiful moment where all your\ndifferent plots intersect. That's what I really love, is when you can take multiple plots\nlike a character arc, where the character makes that last big decision or understands\nat last the thing that they have been missing about their life, overlapping with a big surprise,\noverlapping with the climax of the story, that's where a story can really get me, if\nthey can do that. So, Brandon, what about discovery plotting.\nI don't have a ton to say on this, because I don't do it. I would recommend going to\nother people who do discovery write, reading what Stephen King talks about with discovery\nwriting, reading what George R. R. Martin says about gardening.\nI will tell you one thing you can try, and we'll end here. Mary Robinette, which if she\ngoes to a Q&A here you can ask her about it, taught me a discovery writing method that\nworks pretty well, and it is called \"yes, but/no, and.\" Yes, but/no, and focuses on\ntaking a character, throwing them into some sort of terrible situation at the very start,\nand then just asking yourself, all right, what's the most intelligent or reasonable\nthing they could do right now to get out of", "4117": " this problem? Have them do that, and then\nask yourself, does it work? If you say yes, you add a but, something else has gone wrong.\nOr you say no, and you escalate that problem to a bigger problem.\nWhat this does is it creates this sort of sense of motion where something is always\ngoing wrong for the character, which can be really handy to keep your stakes up in a discovery\nwritten story. Afterward, after you've written the book, you can go back and say, okay, can\nI move all of these things into being pieces of a larger plot? Can I somehow tweak this\nso this one is foreshadowing for this one? But as you're writing, you can just remember,\neverything needs to be getting worse a lot of the time. And yes, but/no, and is a method\nof doing that. You can find a lot of them online. I would recommend listening to what\nother writers say. You've heard a lot today about my method. Go research other methods.\nTry out a lot of different things. See what works for you. I'll do Q&A next weeks on anything\nabout plotting you guys want to know. And that's it."}, "4": {"0": " All right, guys, today writer going to answer\nquestions. Yay! CLASS: Yay! The things that you guys have written down\nfor me about plot we're going to talk over, and then if I get bored of that we'll do maybe\na short lecture, maybe not. It depends on how bored of answering your\nquestions that I get. I'm just going to go down this list that my\nassistant has given me, and I'm going to cherry pick some questions. If you have other questions about plot you\nwant to throw at me if we don't get to yours, we will do for questions from the audience\ntoday as well. \"How long is too long for introductions?\" Is the first question. This an interesting question because, like\nmost writing questions the answer is \"it depends\" on a lot of factors. Novels are not like screenplays where it's\nvery easy to pinpoint the number of pages you should spend doing a given thing because\na novel's length is going to vary wildly and your structure is going to vary wildly, depending\non your own preferences and the genre you're writing in. While you can a screenplay format book that's\ngoing to be like, \"On page 6 you should have done this,\" I can't tell you that for your\nnovel. I can tell you this. You generally want to go a little faster into\nit that you are comfortable as a new writer. The sooner you can introduce the tone of your\nstory and your character's main conflict, maybe not the main conflict of the plot, but\nhow the character is going to relate to it, the better off you're going to be. What you want to really do is you want to\nsell us on being in this character's head, and that is your-- if you can do nothing but\nsell us on the character's personality in the first couple of chapters, you can coast\na long way on that in a novel. This will also depend on your genre. And, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately,\nhow famous you are. Let me explain. Readers going into a book are going to come\ninto it willing to give you a certain amount of leeway. If they have read previous books by you that\nhave had excellent payoffs by the end of that book, then they will give you longer to establish\nyour introduction because they know that the payoff will be worth it. This is the advantage you get when you release\na number of books, and it's why I can get away with Way of Kings more easily than you\ncould get away with Way of Kings. I still would recommend you follow your passion\nfor telling the type of story you want to tell, even if it is something like Way of\nKings that is going to have a steeper learning curve. Do your thing. But understand, there's this way I talk about\nstories and people picking up stories.", "200": " It's like, every reader has a certain number\nof, like a threshold of crap they'll let an author get away with. Everyone's threshold is different, and the\nthings they count as crap that they have to let the author get away with is different\nbased on the individual. For instance, some readers might pick up a\nbook like this and that's immediately, \"All right, I'm skeptical, Sanderson. I have read big books like this before that\nhave meandered a ton and then haven't had a good payoff. And because that's my experience, that's crap\nthat is going against your stuff I have to put up with.\" You already have basically a red mark against\nyou. Other people pick up that book and go, \"Oh,\nI've had wonderful experiences with big books. It is way cheaper on my pocketbook to buy\nthis with an Audible credit instead of this with an Audible credit. Same price. One gives me 9 hours. One gives me 55 hours.\" If you want to know why Oathbringer was the\nsingle most preordered book in the history of Audible, 55 hours. You can see how that reader desire and expectation\nplays into giving you a red mark, or maybe a green mark? Something like that. Readers all have different thresholds here. But generally, you want to have as few red\nmarks as possible for the story you want to tell. The story you want to tell is more important\nthan getting rid of all red marks. If you try to get rid of all potential red\nmarks that anyone could have against your book, your book will probably turn out to\nbe bland and uninteresting and nobody will love it. So you're going to have to take risks. You're going to have to do some things that\nare going to turn off some readers, but then are going to become selling points to other\nreaders. That's why we have genre sections in bookstores,\nbecause certain people, \"That corner of Barnes & Noble is the danger zone of nerddom and\nI will never walk over there,\" and others are for sure like, \"Okay, where's the sci-fi\nsection? Here.\" That doesn't mean that we wouldn't enjoy other\ntypes of stories, but we have enjoyed enough stories in the past of this sort of thing,\nthat being sci-fi/fantasy immediately gives us more of this green mark, so to speak. It gives us more threshold. We're like more willing to buy in.", "355": " This is a long way of saying how long is your\nintroduction. Make it as short as possible to achieve your\ngoals for the type of story you're telling. Get as soon as possible into the main characters\nhead, the main characters conflict, and the proper tone of your story, as soon as is possible\nfor the type of story you want to tell. You will rarely ever get feedback that, \"Your\nbook started off too explosively and too interestingly, and I was too interested in the character.\" Never going to get that feedback. You might get feedback that they're like,\n\"It progressed so quickly I didn't have time to get to know the character, and I got whiplash,\"\nor things like that. That can totally happen. \"How do you reverse engineer good stories\nto rob them for their parts?\" And another question from the next week's\nwas, \"Can you give us a big master list of all the plot archetypes that are out there? Pretty please?\" There were a bunch of you that wanted this. I can't. Because I haven't been able to find one. Because I'm not sure how if people-- I know\na lot of people-- I share this story about Joe Russo because I'm like, okay, I know other\npeople do this. I met someone else that does it, that is able\nto describe this way. I'm sure there are lots of people out there\nthat do this, but I don't think anyone's made a list. If you look for \"What are the basic stories?\" They will boil it down a little too far, and\nyou'll end up with rags to riches, that plot archetype, which is fine. But rags to riches, they're \u201cHere are the\nseven stories.\u201d I don't want the seven stories. I want the 200 stories that are very commonly\nused that you can adapt and create a framework. I have not found anyone who has a good list\nof that. But Writing Excuses Elemental Genres season,\nwhich I think is Season 11, we spend all of that year breaking down Brandon's philosophy\non this story structure thing, and we look at something like, here's a thriller type\nof plot, here's how you build one of these, and here are some examples. And that might be your answer in long form. I don't have just a list of them, I'm afraid. Start making your own list. When you go and you watch a movie. The Marvel movies are actually really good\nfor this. Because the Marvel movies are all superhero\nmovies, but one of the things that they have done is they've said, \"Well, we're going to\nmake each of them a different genre of film.\" For instance, Captain America, The Winter\nSoldier is a spy thriller. It's hits all the beats of what a spy thriller\nis, and you can compare that to several of the Mission Impossibles and to other spy thrillers\nand be like, all right, spy thriller type thing. Whereas the Ant Man films are comedic heists. And you can be like, oh here are the heist\nbeats for a kind of comedic small crew heist, as opposed to a large crew heist. You can just kind of look at each of those\nand be like, all right, here's Thor. It's our epic fantasy. Here is this-- you just start splitting them\nup. But start watching the movies you watch in\na different way. Start reading the books you read in a different\nway. Say, can I boil this down to some similar\nthemes and similar plot archetypes of others and build your own. Because I don't think there's one out there\nthat covers all of these types of things the way that we would want, or at least the way\nthat I like to talk about them.", "577": " Let's see. \"How can I more effectively nest plots? How do you keep those from feeling like diversions?\" There were a number of questions along the\nlines of how do I make sure that my subplots don't feel like diversions, or that they're\ninteresting to the reader, and how do I nest these things properly? Really good question, because this is something\nthat is hard to do. You might notice sometimes that you see a\nfilm and you'll feel like, \"This portion is just a bunch of characters spinning their\nwheels and not accomplishing anything, and I felt bored by that side quest that they\nwere sent on.\" How do you make the side quest relevant to\nthe main story? How do you make multiple characters plot lines\nrelevant? One thing I'll warn you of is that readers\nwill generally pick their favorites out of a cast of characters. I've found that generally they will gravitate\nand pick a least favorite, a most favorite, and a \"I don't care\" if there's like three. But there always seems to be this balance\nof \"This is my favorite.\" And the further you write in your book, the\nmore that that weight will actually, a lot of readers will just kind of pick up momentum\non that. \"Oh, this is the character I don't want to\nread as much.\" It becomes kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is one of the dangers of large, multi-viewpoint\nbooks. Of course, the advantage you gets is the variety\nis itself a big green checkmark for a lot of readers, where they would rather read even\nsome characters they're not as interested in occasionally to keep the story having a\nlot of variety and to have the epic scope, which is why we often like to write these\nbig epics. But I will warn you, sometimes that's going\nto happen, and sometimes it's inevitable. At least, if it's not inevitable, I haven't\nyet found the method of making a large cast dynamic with multiple viewpoints that people\ndon't start polarizing about their favorites as they compare them. Perhaps there is a way to do it that I haven't\nfigured out yet.", "698": " But, how do you make your side plots relevant? Well, there are a couple of ways to do this. One of them is to make sure that we are really\ninvested and engaged by the viewpoint characters and we understand their motivations. Not to pile on The Last Jedi, because there\nare a lot of good things about that film. I'm impressed with a lot of what Ryan Johnson\nwas trying to do in that film. But one of the things that a lot of people\nsay is, the plot with Finn and Rose felt very-- it didn't connect with a lot of people in\nthe same way. This might have to do with promises and connecting\nto the character. For instance, Finn is introduced in the movie\nin a way that, if you haven't seen it, this is a character who had an interesting relationship\nwith another character in the first movie, and then is introduced in the next movie saying,\n\"I need to get to my friend and I need to help my friend.\" And instead of doing that, the story sends\nhim on a side quest. This is very much the same problem I had in\nthe original draft of Oathbringer, where I say, here is your promise. This character's really interested in X, and\nall the characters are really interested in going to X, and then I sent them to Y. And the initial draft everyone's like, yeah,\nbut this is the side quest. I know this is the side quest. When are we going to get to what you've told\nme was the main story? So Finn coming out and saying, \"I need to\nget to Rey, my friend, and help her some way,\" but somehow ends up on this wacky adventure\nriding horses and things, where all the while you're been keyed in your head to be like,\n\"Yeah, but--\" Even though after that introduction they did work to try and establish why this\nside quest was important, it just felt like the character wasn't achieving his motivations,\nand we were not invested in what the character was doing to the extent that we wanted to\nbe. We were really invested in the A plot of that\nmovie, a lot of people were, and then the B plot of the movie seemed like it was going\nto be involved and then wasn't. It's hard to pick apart why something like\nthis, a very successful movie is not something I want to sit and bag on, but I look at that\nand think there's a lesson there in making sure when you are doing these subplots with\nyour side characters, make sure the reader is invested and wanting to see more of that\ncharacter, or at least that their character arc is going to be engaging and interesting. Make sure you're making right promises for\nthat character, and the showing progress upon the thing you promised the reader that you\nwere going to get. You use all the same sort of tools you use\nfor the main plot line on this side character. And then it is usually really handy to start\nshowing how this is going to combine to the main story, how it's relevant to the main\nstory in some way.", "870": " Now, this isn't an absolute must. Particularly in a lot of epic fantasies, you\nstart with, here are four characters in different parts of the world, and they're doing their\nown thing, and you're not quite sure how they connect until at the end of the first book\nand maybe not even until later volumes, and in that case you have to treat them each like\ntheir own book, rather than side quests, which means do all the things that you're doing\nwith the other characters. Make sure people are invested, that you have\nprogress, that you have plotting and these sorts of things. If you do your job right, people will be invested\nin that character to the point that it won't feel like a deviation from the main plot. It will feel like its own secondary plot. Those are separate from the stories where\nall the characters are together, and you want to start to express subthemes and subcharacters. This sort of thing just kind of comes down\nto making sure you're keeping a good balance. It's much easier if all your characters are\nin the same place. The reader's going to give you a ton more\nleeway if your characters are all together, at least at the start of the story. Guardians of the Galaxy, the second Guardians\nof the Galaxy movie, is a good example of giving a lot of subplots to a lot of different\ncharacters, and introducing them all while they're together, and then some of them split\noff a little bit. But the idea is you're invested in this whole,\nand you're invested in the story, and then because so many of them are together for so\nmuch of it, taking a little bit of time away to find out why this character's this, or\nwhy this character's that, and then wrapping up those arcs, can feel very satisfying when\neverybody kind of has their own little mini arc through the course of the story. You have an advantage over a filmmaker in\nthat you have way more pages to play with. You can take a chapter or two now and then\nfor a side character, and particularly if they're all on the same place on the same\nquest, and you're still like-- What you want to do is you'll be like, \"We're going to see\nthrough Character D's eyes for this chapter. And this character's perspective on what we're\ndoing as we go on our quest is going to add a new and interesting view of this quest,\nand we're going to see they have this subplot where they are in love with this other character,\nand they haven't expressed it openly.\" And you say, \"Oh, that's really cool.\" But you also still get the main plot progressing. Because say they're on a travelogue. They arrive at this next place. You're still progressing your main plot while\nshowing the world through a different character's eyes. Way easier in that case than if you split\nthem up. But, like I said, if you do your job right,\nif you treat them all as when you're in their eyes, they are the protagonist of their own\nstory, then you're going to be much-- you're not going to have problems with this as much\nas you might think.", "1044": " \"Sometimes twists can be clich\u00e9, because\nsome writers just write twists for twists' sake. How can I avoid that?\" Excellent question. And this is a relevant thing to be asking\nyourself and to be thinking about. Early in my career, particularly when I was\nunpublished but getting really close to being published, I started to find that I was doing\nthis, that I'm like, \"There aren't enough twists in this book. I'm going to put in more.\" I had to step back and start asking myself\nwhy. What emotion is this twist adding? What is the purpose of it? There are totally valid purposes for twists. When, early in a book, when you kill of a\nmain character in a way that is unexpected, it can add tension for the rest of the story\nand the rest of the series. Game of Thrones did this and earned a huge\namount of sort of tension-building ability by giving the idea that main characters were\nnot safe from being killed, and in fact, it became the big selling point for the series,\nis it's a series where characters are not protected from the consequences of their actions,\nwhich is why many people were upset later in the series when it started to seem like\npeople were being protected from the consequence of their actions. It became the selling point. So that twist, the idea of taking the reader's\nexpectations and turning them against the reader, that subversion, serves a real purpose\nin that story. You can ask yourself what does this subversion\nmean. But let me tell you a story I often relate\nin this class that I haven't done this year yet. This is about, so forgive me if you've heard\nthis story, I have a friend who released a first book around the same time that I did. Mine really took off and this friend's book\nseries just did not take off on the same level. One time we were sitting and chatting, and\nI had read some of this book but had decided pretty early on it just wasn't a book for\nme. It was not poorly written. It was a perfectly acceptable book. But it just didn't quite work for me. He was asking, \"So why was that?\" I'm like, \"Well, it felt like a very kind\nof standard quest fantasy, a very Terry Brooks-esque standard quest fantasy. I really enjoyed those when I was younger\nand read a bunch of them, but I'm, as a reader, just kind of bored of that story. I've read it enough times that I just don't\nwant to read it anymore. I've heard a lot of feedback from people about\nthis same idea.\" And he said, \"But that's the thing. About the three-quarter mark you realize that\nit isn't a standard quest fantasy. It turns everything on its head. It inverts all of those tropes, and it undermines\neverything you've been thinking. It does this really cool new direction for\nthe story.\" Now, I didn't get there, so I can't speak\nto whether this is true or not. But it set me thinking a lot about this idea\nof subverting expectations and twists as stories go. His book seems a perfect example of why simply\nsubverting expectations is not itself necessarily a virtue. This is because if you wanted a classic quest\nTerry Brooks fantasy and you read this book, what is your reaction likely to be? \"Hey, you gave me three quarters of the book\nfull of promises of a certain style, and I'm the person that wanted that, and then you\ntook it away from me at the end.\" Now, if you're a person who loves subverted\nexpectations, and you love the idea of taking classic tropes and twisting them and mangling\nthem, what happens to you? What's your response to this book? \u201cI don't get to the part that I would enjoy,\nbecause I'm bored by the first three quarters of it.\u201d So whether or not the book actually did this,\nthis is an interesting object lesson, I think, for you to take, where not fulfilling on your\npromises is not a virtue. Now, if you can do a subversion in a way that\ngives the reader more than they expected, better than they expected, or if you spent\na lot of time convincing them they actually want something else, then you give them that,\nthen those subversions all work. And if you can use a subversion to expand\nthe reader's desire to see more, if you can expand on a character-- The classic example\nof this is at the end of the second Star Wars movie, well, the fifth, you know what I mean,\nEmpire Strikes Back, when we find out that Darth Vader is Luke's father. Now, this was not necessarily something we\nwere wanting. So you could say, \"Well, this wasn't promised,\"\nthough it kind of was because you had foreshadowing with the cutting off of Vader's head and there's\nLuke's face in it during the training. So there are those little clues. But you could say, \"No, no. I wasn't getting into this story to have a\nhuge reveal at the end. So why does that work when this other he pulled\nthe rug out from underneath doesn't?\" T\nhe reason mainly being is this story is about Luke's quest. It's about his journey as a character. This thing at the end lends us huge investment\nin his character as it develops. You knew something was going to go wrong,\nbecause you don't have the main character ignore Yoda and have it turn out all right. Like, that is totally set up. So you knew something. You were prepped. You have this dangerous scene where he's training\nwith Yoda. He disobeys his master. He goes off. Everything's going wrong, and you know that\nthe other show is going to drop. You've been promised that. You're really kind of wanting it, right? You're wanting, \"Oh, Luke better pay for this.\" Then he finds out about this whole thing,\nand it's earthshaking, and it's incredible, and it expands your understanding of the character. It introduced new conflict that's going to\nbe really interesting into this relationship. It is not so much a subversion, though it\nis slightly, as a really great escalation of the conflict.", "1428": " So try to do that if you can. Escalate instead of completely undermine. All right. \"Will Spensa and Jorgen ever get ma-a-a-ried?\"\nwith lots of i's. \u201cCan a story be sort of episodic and still\nkeep you turning the page?\u201d Yes, you absolutely can. A story can be episodic and keep you turning\nthe page. Most of the time, the secret to episodic page\nturners is to have a good hook at the end of your episode to promise what the next episode's\ngoing to be and make that really interesting. One of my personal philosophies is, if you're\ngoing to do this, there are two ways that you can give a twist hook ending to a chapter\nor an episode of something you're doing. One is to say, she went to the door. The knock came to the door. She went to it and opened the door and-- cut. This is kind of a classic mystery formula\nhook at the end. Then you turn the page to find out who's at\nthe door. You can do those. It's kind of a dirty trick, but we do dirty\ntricks in writing all the time. If you can instead have her open the door\nand it is her father that she thought was dead, and then cut, that is a better hook. Because that hook only works if you have properly\nset up who the character is so the reader can infer what this twist means. Those twists at the end of episodes are going\nto be just far better, far, far better if you can come up with them. The problem with the open-the-door-and, you\nhave probably read books like this, if you haven't, you probably actually have and you\ndidn't notice, a lot of them is they open the door and-- start the next chapter, it\nwas the pizza delivery person. They got pizza. I'm exaggerating, but a lot of times authors\nknow to put this sort of hook at the end of a chapter or the end of an episode, but they\ndon't actually know how to make the next thing interesting, so they use the cheap trick to\nget you to turn the page, but once you've read another age you're kind of committed\nto another chapter, and so you keep reading. Avoid those if you can, and instead make them\nlegitimate moments of crisis or curiosity to the reader to get them to turn to the next\nepisode. That is how you get a page turner out of something\nepisodic. Television does this a lot. This is main television format, is to try\nto give you a stinger at the end of an episode to bring you back next week. Again, some of those are dirty tricks, and\nsome of them I don't like, but you can learn a lot from that method. So if you are writing something episodic,\nlooking at great episodic works like some of the better television shows, will teach\nyou how to do this. But yeah, you can have page turners. Then after that point, once they turn that\npage, you're over the big hump. The big hump is, will this start the next\nepisode? Because once they do, you have a chance to\nhook them with character, with conflict, and with your expert storytelling again, and keep\nahold of them.", "1638": " All right. Let's see. Hmm, that's a spoiler. \u201cIs there always a twist?\u201d There does not always have to be a twist. Now, it depends on your definition of a twist. They're usually, in fact almost all cases,\nit should be an escalation. An escalation does not have to be a twist,\nbut it usually fills the same role as a twist. An escalation is when things get worse. The status quo has changed, but it is changing\nin the wrong direction. This is why most romantic comedies, even though\nyou know they're going to get together, everyone knows they're going to get together, has a\nbreakup scene somewhere around the three-quarter mark of the story. You could call this a twist, and it can happen\nbecause of a twist. But a lot of times it's just the two characters'\npersonalities. You've seen the thorns all along. Remember how I told you about Dave braiding\nroses? You've seen the thorns, and you've started\nbraiding them, but right near the end two thorns just jab into each other. You knew it was possible. You were kind of waiting for it. It does, and now, oh, no! Everything's gotten worse because she knows\nthe worst thing about him, and he knows the worst thing about her. This can be handled very expertly. It can be handled very poorly. I'm sure you have seen both. But the idea is, there is an escalation. Problems are being introduced, more obstacles. Things are getting worse. Like I said, those fill the same function. A twist should generally fill one of those\nsame sort of functions. When the twist happens it should escalate\nthe problem. It should make you reassess goals. It should make you look at the story in a\ndifferent way and in hopefully a way that makes the reader more excited and more interesting. Discovering that Luke is Darth Vader's father\nis a great escalation twist.", "1755": " Yeah, backwards, yeah. Eh, you know, it's Lucas. Who knows? But yes, Darth Vader is Luke's father, that's\na great escalation because these two characters are already in conflict. The story has been introduced that they're\ngoing to be in conflict. The story is building to a confrontation between\nthem, which you now know Luke has lost, and then you are given a twist, which expands\nthe scope of their conflict to new and unforeseen dimensions, that also puts Luke in conflict\nwith his other father, Obi Wan, who now lied to him. So suddenly it's a twist that expands the\nconflict in beautiful ways. It is the picture-perfect way to manage a\ntwist in your story. Try to make your twists escalate, but you\ndon't have to have them. You can just have the problems mount and mount\nand mount, and then people overcome them. Don't, particularly twist endings, get hung\nup on twist endings too much. Being satisfying is generally better than\nhaving a twist. Generally, if you can have your twist also\nbe satisfying, it's going to, in general, be better than either of those two former\noptions. But if the twist makes your ending unsatisfying,\nthen you have to have a very special story for that to work. Can work. It's really hard. I often bring up Into the Woods and things\nlike this, which are stories that are about deconstructing a story and about the reader\nhaving a miserable experience in some ways and enjoying that miserable experience. Those sorts of stories can work with a twist\nthat is not satisfying because there's a kind of native satisfaction in the \"Oh, you got\nme. You got me. I thought I was going to be happy and now\nI'm sad. And that makes me so happy, but I don't want\nto talk about it, because I just want to be mad at you.\" Really tough to pull off, but possible, obviously.", "1886": " \"How can I tell if it's my character or my\nplot that needs to change?\" There's a couple different ways for me to\nread this. I don't know if I talked to you guys about\nthe idea that a lot of times I think this is building off of the idea that sometimes\nI am writing a book, and I tend to discovery write my characters, and so they grow to be\nsomething that isn't going to fulfill what the plot of the story would indicate. At that point, you kind of reach, as a writer,\na crisis moment where you're like, \"All right, I've built this cool plot for the character\nto go on.\" You discovery writers, you're like, \"I don't\ndo that, so I don't have to worry about this.\" But maybe you're writing along and you get\nthat sense. The more you write, the more of an instinct\nyou have when things are working and when they're not. This starts to build as you finish multiple\nnovels, or multiple short stories if you're a short story writer. If you haven't finished multiple, you probably\ndon't have this instinct yet. You might think that you do oh, but you don't. Because this comes from a familiarity with\nyour own process and you trying things that have worked in the past and then finding out\nthey're not working this time. That is different from what is probably happening\nif you are a new writer and you haven't finished multiple books and stories, which is, you\nget to the middle, you've never written a middle before, middles are hard, and you get\nwriter's block. That is different from, you finished 8 novels,\nyou are three-quarters of the way through your book, and you know it's not working. You know something is fundamentally broken. All of the things that you have done in the\npast that have worked, you have tried, and this time it's not working. Two very different problems. The latter one you can really only figure\nout by instinct. If you are a newer writer, my recommendation\nis that most of the time finish the story. Don't stop, even if you think something is\nfundamentally broken, because the mere act of finishing the story will start to give\nyou the tools to fix that story. The best cure for most writers\u2019 writers\nblock, in my experience, has been to write anyway. Nobody's taking your pen away. No one's unplugged your laptop. When we talk about writer's block it usually\nmeans my subconscious feels something is wrong with this book and I don't know what that\nthing is that is wrong. Or, my subconscious is terrified about the\nfact that I don't know where this is going and I feel like I should, so I'm a fraud,\nand so I can't keep going. As a new writer, those things can be very\nparalyzing, and all of their cousins that work like that, and the answer to both of\nthem is, remember that your job in writing right now is not to create a perfect book. Maybe you will. Maybe your Pat Rothfuss and you will write\na brilliant first novel. It happens. Harry Potter was a first novel. Thirteen drafts, I think she said, but a first\nnovel. It's possible. But most likely, your job right now in writing\nis to turn yourself into a person who can write great novels, not writing a great novel,\nbecause you just don't have the skill yet to do that. And even if you do, you're probably going\nto have to revise many, many times, and you need a finished product to do that. The best advice for most new writers is, just\nkeep writing. Do something. Have something happen. Go ask your roommate, your spouse, your kid,\nwhatever. Say, hey, what should I do? Your kid, they're going to be like, they go\nplay Fortnite. So your characters go play Fortnite, or whatever. Have something, just do something. Even as an established professional who has\nwritten a lot, my go-to when I have this feeling that something is wrong is to write anyway\nand see if it persists across a couple of chapters, because even still, more often than\nnot, writing that chapter the wrong way will put it into my subconscious and across the\nnext day while I'm thinking about it my brain will say, ah, now that we have a finished\nbroken chapter I can fix that. I have all the tools from studying writing\nfor so long that I can look at something broken and say, you had the wrong viewpoint for this\nchapter. That's why it's wrong. We need to be in this character's head and\nmake this revelation, which would turn the plot the way that we want it to be going. Nine times out of ten, the next day, I set\nthat chapter aside, I write a new one, and that one goes in the book, and it works. Even still, once in a while there's a bigger\nproblem than that. This is when I dig out all of the writing\ntools that I talk about in class, that my friends talk about using, that I see in books\non instruction in writing. I say, all right, let's break this down to\nthings like, where are my motivations for my characters? What are my promises? What is my plot archetype and my trajectory? How am I pacing? How am I doing? And I start digging apart the story and looking\nfor where the problem is using all of these tools. Almost always I then find the solution. Sometimes I don't. I had a book a couple years ago, The Apocalypse\nGuard. I still don't know how to fix it. I could identify that something was wrong. My editor agreed. It wasn't just that I was having an off time. But the book just didn't click, didn't come\ntogether, and I still don't know what's wrong with it. I had the same problem with The Way of Kings\nin 2002. I managed to spend 9 years, no, 8 years, thinking\nabout that book in the back of my brain, came to the decision of what I had done wrong fundamentally\nin the story, wrote it again. I guess it was 2009 I wrote it again. It came out in 2010. So 7 years of time later I knew what to do\nand I started from scratch and the book worked that time. That's maybe not what you want to hear, because\nit's-- well, take 7 years. Maybe it'll work out. All right.", "2264": " Let's ask for any questions from you guys,\nand then I'm going to jump into the next week's questions. Anything you guys want me to get to? All right. We'll go over here. Yeah? Q: How can a really character-driven plot,\nlike say Name of the Wind was, because when you do that it feels just kind of like meandering\naround. Right. Good question. Q: Probably not [___]. Yeah. So how can a very character-driven plot work,\nusing Name of the Wind as an example, because it is basically, it is a series of vignettes\ntied together by a character. So how can that work? That actually brings me into, if you guys\nwill let me deviate for a minute and talk a little bit about what I want to talk about\ntoday. Where are our markers? Right here? Oh, there we are. All right let me do a short little lecture\non viewpoint. Right? Viewpoint. Because the answer to this is deeply connected\nto viewpoint and what we're doing. So viewpoint. There are three standard viewpoints that you\ncan use, of which two are really the ones that people use. We have omniscient. Om-ni-scient. I can spell that, right? We have first person. And we have second person. Yes. Of these you're probably going to use omniscient,\nor you're going to use first person. Second person is used, \"You did this. You did that.\" Choose Your Own Adventure novels are usually\nin second person or some version of them. Nora's Broken Earth Trilogy uses second person\nquite extensively. It's usually very literary and very difficult\nto use or very pulpy and very Choose Your Own Adventure. Second person, generally, I would recommend\ndon't do unless you want to make it a major selling point of your story and you know what\nyou're doing. So that brings us down to our two main viewpoints. Now the nice thing about these viewpoints\nis, there are a lot of different models you can choose among these. Each of them break down to a couple things. First person has what we call epistolary.", "2408": " I think I spelled that right. I don't know. So epistolary is where all of the story is\nbeing told through ephemera or pieces of writing that someone has found and collected. So Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an epistolary story. It is written in diary form, where the character\nis writing it down. Dracula is a classic example of this. It is mixing letters and people's journals\ntogether to create a narrative. There was a really cool one that came out\na number of years ago now, like 5-6 years ago, called Illuminae, which was told through\nredacted documents that an agency had gathered together that had all the reductions on them\nand stuff. It was text conversations, and letters, and\nemails and things constructed into a story. Epistolary can be very fun. Another famous example from sci-fi/fantasy\nis Sorcery and Cecelia, which I believe, I could be wrong on this, but I believe the\nauthors that wrote it were just exchanging letters as if they were their characters,\nand then they published that as a novel. Which is great, right? That's just a really cool way to write a book. \"Here's what happened in my life.\" \"Here's what happened in my life.\" And then being professional writers, they\nwork in these connections. I think that's where it went. I might be thinking of a different one. But these sorts of things can do really fun\nthings with epistolary. We have kind of another one. These are kind of more my terms for them. You won't find these online necessarily. But we have the, what'll I call it today? I call it something different every year. We call it the flashback. This is your classic first person. You're classic first person is your flashbacks\nnarrative where someone is telling you a story. The character basically is two characters. They are the person they were in the story,\nand they were the person that they are now. This is Name of the Wind. Name of the Wind is the character now telling\nyou about the story of how they became who they are. Classic first-person storytelling method. This is, in many ways this is actually what\nThe Hobbit is, though it's actually kind of a hybrid between this and an omniscient present\nnarrator. Because Bilbo pretends he's not writing the\nbook, even though he is, even though Tolkien--so Tolkien is pretending to be Bilbo who is pretending\nto not be Bilbo writing a book. Right? Yes. But flashback, sci-fi fantasy version of this,\nthe Farseer books by Robin Hobb are told as first-person narratives. They're kind of separated from epistolary,\nin that you get the sense that yes, this is the writer telling the story, the narrator,\nthe person, but it's not actually necessary have to be ephemera. A writer doing a flashback type of story will\ninclude way more detail than someone actually writing in their journal would. It reads like a novel, just someone telling\nyou the story, and that's part of the affectation of it, is it's someone's going to tell you\ntheir life story, but it comes across like, Name of the Wind takes like 40 hours to listen\nto but they pretend he's telling the story in one sitting or two sittings or something\nlike that. That's actually impossible, but it works. But that's a flashback story. The third is the, I'll call it cinematic this\ntime. I've used different terms for it. The definition of this one is, this is the\nkind of standard for YA right now, which is, it\u2019s being told in the first-person but\nkind of as if the character were narrating their life as they're living it right now. It's not being written down. It's not actually being told to you. But you are instead, like you have a little,\nlike you've embedded an implant into their brain, and that implant, as they are thinking,\nis framing all their thoughts into first person and they are living their life this way. There's no expectation that there's going\nto be a frame story or any sort of thing telling you that this is a journal. There's no epistolary things. It is just a first-person story told in kind\nof an immediate sense. I often called this immediate first person. Usually that one is in present tense, while\nusually the other two are in past tense. These each give you something. They're each tools that you can use. Omniscient has similar ones. We have what we call a present narrator. And when I say we call it, I call it today,\npresent narrator. So present narrator, what is this? Well, this is where there's a storyteller\ntelling you a story, and it's a hybrid between first person and omniscient where, while in\nthe story, you are not in any one characters head. The narrator is jumping all around and telling\nyou things. Basically you have a first-person frame story\nof the person jumping into an omniscient narrator telling you a story. Aladdin kind of uses this sort of thing a\nlittle bit, even though it's cinematic so it's not in anyone's head. What's some good examples of this? The Hobbit is a good example of this. In fact, it's the quintessential example. The idea is that Bilbo is writing the story\ndown, but while he's telling the story, he's jumping into other people's heads and giving\nyou their thoughts, even though when Bilbo himself was in that story he didn't know them. Anytime a writer writes the words, \"They didn't\nknow it at the time but,\" that's usually some sort of present narrator. You see this a lot in comics with the present\nnarrator where there is like an omniscient narrator who's telling you the story, stuff\nlike that. Then you have true omniscient, which is, you\nare going to write an omniscient piece where there's no necessary narrator, but you have,\nas the reader, access to everyone's thoughts and emotions concurrently. A given paragraph could be in any viewpoint\nat any time and the author will decide this, but the author is generally not going to withhold\nany information from you. Dune is the classic sci-fi example. When someone walks on stage that's going to\nbetray them, you jump in his head and he's like, \"Boy, it's going to suck when I betray\nthese people.\" You as the reader are being given all the\ninformation. This is why, is it David Lynch who made the\nfilm? If you watch the original cut of Dune, even\nthe theatrical cut of Dune, the original movie, you are often getting the characters thoughts\nas voice-overs when they are sitting there, because the book is in omniscient and they\nare trying to find a way to do that cinematically, and it's really weird. I don't need to say that about Lynch's work,\nbut that's taken for granted. And then you have limited.", "2835": " Third limited is, of these, I would say the\nmost common that you are going to do are going to be this one, this one, and this one. Ninety-plus percent of all books published\nare one of these three. Limited is, for a given scene, you pick one\ncharacter's viewpoint, you see through only their eyes. You'll only see and understand their thoughts,\nand everyone else, any thoughts they may have, are the character interpreting them saying,\n\"It seemed like they might be wanting this,\" or something like that. You are very soundly rooting someone in someone's\nhead, but as soon as you change scenes, you can change to a different head to be in. When we say third Limited, why it's under\nomniscient is because you can be in anyone's head, but only one at the same time. The reason this lecture, this thing came out\nwhen you asked about character-driven stories is these styles tend to involve advantages\nand disadvantages. And one of the big advantages of first-person\nis that if that character's voice is interesting, then you can get away with a ton of stuff\nthat you can't get away with in, particularly if they're in limited. If reading the character's voice, they are\nbeautiful, poetic, or funny, or sarcastic, or something like that, it covers a whole\nhost of sins that otherwise the story would feel boring because of. Info dumps in first person are a lot easier,\nbecause since you can put them in the first person character's perspective and tell a\nfunny joke or give a really lush and interesting, poetic paragraph as the description, that\nitself become such a selling point that you kind of want to linger, and you want the info\ndump to maybe go a little longer because you're learning so much about the character and having\nso much fun with them. And that dynamic is a huge part of what makes\nName of the Wind work. Name of the Wind does the reverse of a lot\nof stories, in that a lot of stories will use the present narrator and kind of have\nthis frame story and things like that. The frame story is third limited in Name of\nthe Wind, and then the first-person narrative starts up as he's sitting down to tell his\nstory to the person who's come to collect his story, which is a really ingenious frame\nstory. It works really well. And because of that you get all these sorts\nof things. You get his voice being a drawing point or\na selling point for the story. And beyond that you get the sense of a storyteller\ntelling you a story, kind of like present narrator, but done in a very strict first-person\nflashback sense. And you are really interested in this character. And so almost all the plot progression can\nbe character motivated. Instead of, \"We need to go to the place and\nget the thing\" being the way your progress is, you are shifted into thinking, \"How is\nmy character changing as they go to the place and get the thing?\" Getting the thing doesn't matter, but what\nit does to this character really matters, and it allows you to really focus on them. You can do that in limited. In fact, you should be trying to do that in\nlimited. But in first person, you can really make that\nsort of thing sing. While you're reading, all of your progress\nis character-based. Who is Kvothe becoming? And he gives you a promise in that book by\nshowing you old Kvothe, who's like, what, he's only a couple of years older, but old\nKvothe, right? But old Kvothe, who's beaten down, depressed,\nand has given up, and young Kvothe, who is optimistic and excited and going to take on\nthe world. Your promise is right there. How does young Kvothe become old Kvothe? You have been given right immediately a huge\npromise, and your promise is, this is our progress. It is a character losing their innocence,\nbecoming beaten down, and turning into this person. Which is why if you think the series is going\nto be a comedy and not a tragedy, you may be wrong, would be my expectation. So there you go. That is a large part of your question. Now, since we did all this, let's talk a little\nbit about what each of these can do and what their advantages are and why you might choose\nthem. Let's throw it to you guys. Let's take epistolary. What's an advantage or a disadvantage that\nyou can see of doing an epistolary story? STUDENT: Mystery. Mystery, okay. Mystery. Epistolary has this innate, built-in mystery\nbecause it's the only real-- I won't say only. As opposed to flashback, in flashback you\nknow the character lives. Unless of course it's one of those stories\nwhere the character dies and is telling you the story as a ghost, which totally happens\na lot. So it's not that unique, but it totally can. But either way, the character is around to\ntell you the story. In epistolary, you don't know. You're living it moment by moment. Yeah, what? Go ahead. STUDENT: It's extremely immersive. It is hugely immersive. You can build in all kinds of interesting\nlore and ephemera that you can build into this. If you're doing a full-on epistolary you can\nbe like here is-- like Watchmen does this. If you're reading Watchmen, it does these\nepistolary sections at the end of each comic, which are, \"Here is one of the character's\nmarketing plan for the action figures that they are creating,\" is your epistolary section\nat the end of that comic, which is so cool. It tells you so much about the character. And the questions are, \"Do you think I'll\nget my friends to license the rights for this huge deal that we have coming up? Make mine buffer.\" I don't think he actually writes that, but\nyou know what I mean. It can tell you so much about the characters\nto have something like that. So enormously immersive. What else, advantages or disadvantages of\nepistolary? STUDENT: First a question. Would you say that, like, on a small scale,\nthat Mistborn has a little bit of epistolary in it? Yes. The epigraphs of Mistborn are epistolary. I often use epistolary form in the epigraphs,\nthe beginnings of chapters. STUDENT: You can kind of drop hints. Yeah, you can give up all sorts of cool little\nhints and you can-- in this, it is the easiest", "3219": " of all of these forms of them, in my opinion,\nto hide information from the reader and have them not feel like you're cheating. Even in flashback they'll feel like you're\ncheating if you're hiding information. In epistolary, it just wasn't in that letter,\nright? It's a lot easier to hide information that\nthe character may know. Go ahead. STUDENT: Asking for another example. Is Skyward Cinematic? Because it's written in the past tense. Yeah, Skyward is cinematic. Both Skyward and Steelheart are done in this\ncinematic, or this immediate, whichever way you want to call it, which you are there with\nthe character, in the moment. But Skyward has third person limited interludes\nin between to show other characters' story. This is actually what The Martian does. It's an epistolary that when it's not being\nepistolary its third limited in order to set that off and differentiate it. I think it's third limited in those other\nscenes, if I'm right. A lot of times, switching between one of these\nforms is a really great way to kind of help the reader have some structure when there\nwouldn't otherwise be structure. Like, in Skyward, if you haven't read it,\nthere's a character I knew I was going to want her viewpoint for the ending, because\nI needed to stay externally to have this great moment happen. But I knew if I dropped that viewpoint at\nthe ending it would feel just out of the blue and would kick readers out of the story. So I set them up for it by having a viewpoint\nfor her at the end of each chapter to give further ways of just like looking into the\nworld and into the characters from a different viewpoint, and I set them in third limited\nto be like, this is something different so that you know we're going to come back to\nwhat you've been experiencing, rather than just switching to another character's viewpoint\nalso in first cinematic. So epistolary, if it has limitations, I'll\njust say, big limitation of epistolary is the form. This is kind of a rigid structure that can\nbe difficult to work with. and some place people may not like it as much. Did you have another? STUDENT: I was going to say, when I read epistolatories,\nit can stretch my disbelief a little bit more, especially when they go into great detail. Yep. It totally can. That's one-- I haven't even brought that one\nup before, but absolutely. When you're reading some of these and you're\nlike, \"They really remembered exactly what this person said and put it in their letter\nto this other person verbatim? Come on.\" And if you're doing too much of that, you\nmay want to move to flashback instead. So flashback.", "3368": " Flashback has the big disadvantage of, you\ngenerally know the character lives, which deflates some of the tension. Of course, you can use it effectively by saying\nthe character lives, but the person in the future that you're saying is a very different\nperson, so you get to see how they're changing through the course of time. Not always do you have a frame story. This is what Alcatraz vs. The Evil Librarians\nis, and it has almost no frame story grounding you in the modern-day Alcatraz telling the\nstory about the young Alcatraz. But it still has two characters, because the\ncharacter of Alcatraz is occasionally addressing you in the present tense, and that is the\none who's telling the story to you, not the character that modern Alcatraz is telling\na story about. But flashback. What are some advantages and disadvantages\nto flashback? STUDENT: I'd say the advantage is \nyou really understand the character on an intimate level. Yeah, you really do. In fact, both this and cinematic, the biggest\nselling point is character voice and really getting to understand them. In some ways flashback gives you more, because\nit gives you two time periods to play the same character and that contrast can be really\nfun. The contrast between modern character and\nearly character, really interesting, and a big selling point to this. It's what you get, in fact, by giving away\nthat they live. STUDENT: It makes it really easy to tell your\nreaders, \"Pay attention to this.\" Yeah, yeah. The characters say, \"You should pay attention\nto this. It'll be important later.\" And it's the only one that doesn't feel like\ncheating when you do that. Even the present narrator feels a little like\ncheating. But when the flashback character says the\nthing like, \"I didn't know it at the time.\" You can frame it in a way that makes the reader\nunderstand, \"Ooo, this is important. I better catch this clue.\" Anything else? Yeah? STUDENT: Is the only difference between limited\nand cinematic that you jump between multiple heads? The limited and cinematic, yes, that's the\nmain thing. The main difference, but also there's a tone\ndifference when you're using I. When someone is telling you their own story,\nit feels more personal, and in limited it feels a little more distant. And what this does is, limited, for instance,\nlimited is much harder to have an untrustworthy narrator, an unreliable narrator. In both flashback and cinematic, it's a lot\neasier to have an untrustworthy or unreliable. Even though limited is in someone's head and\nkind of very much colored by the way they see the world, if you are actively lying to\nthe reader in limited, they are going to feel cheated. And in fact, in Mistborn where I have Kelsior,\nI get around this sometimes. Kelsior's got a big secret from the rest of\nthe team. When I'm in his head, he's like, \"I can't\nthink about that thing. It's too painful right now.\" That is the sort of thing you'd have to do\nin limited to keep information, and it is cheating. It is absolutely cheating. It's sometimes a necessary cheat. But you don't have that problem in these others\nbecause the unreliable narrator can say to you, \"It's still too painful for me to talk\nabout. I'll get to it in a minute,\" and you're just\nlike, \"Yeah, I can understand that. This is really hard for you.\" Because we're running low on time, I'll just\nkind of go through the rest of these. These two are very similar except for whether\nyou're going to give away the future or not, but then you lose the ability to play off\nof the future. Their biggest limitation is, the more heads\nyou're in doing a flashback or cinematic, which you will find books that'll do two first-person\nnarrators, or even three, in a cinematic or a flashback, the more you do, the harder it\nis for the reader to track, because they aren't seeing the character's name be repeated very\noften, and because that personal connection you build with the person writing the story\nstarts to get-- like, there's interference. It starts to feel weird to you that you're\nfeeling this deep personal connection to five people, and it just stops working. And the biggest reason to jump to limited\nis that, number one, you get that credibility, that you can say, \"What this character is\nseeing, they're actually seeing.\" The narrator is being straight with you in\nlimited, even if it's colored perspective. And this allows you to have tension between\nwhat the character is seeing and how you're describing it. This works, for instance, Mat Cauthin in The\nWheel of Time. He will have direct thoughts where he's like,\n\"He thinks this,\" and the description of it has completely made it clear that's not what\nit is, and then you get a contrast between reality and the way Mat sees the world, which\nyou can't do very easily in the other thing because they're all filtered through their\nhead. So you have that distance between the character's\nactual voice in their head. Still, when you write limited you want every\ndescription to be colored through the lens of how that character sees the world. But there's a trustworthiness to it that you\ndon't have in the other one. It is much better for large casts also, because\nallowing you to keep track of this large cast of characters by using their names more often\nand by having that little bit of distance where the reader is kind of understanding\nthat a storyteller is telling them the story, and now they're in this head, this head, this\nhead. You can have a one-off viewpoint in limited\nreally easily where you're like, \"Everything else has been in this character. We're going to jump in this character's head\nnow.\" This is the Tom Clancy method, right? It's just like, who is this? But it works because it's third limited. Omniscient is really hard. I would recommend studying if you want to\ndo it. What it gains you is you have this really\ninteresting form that not a lot of people do anymore. But you have to build your tension based on,\nnot mysteries, but instead tension based on expecting and anticipation. Something terrible is going to happen. I know what it's going to be. Let me see how the characters react because\nI've already seen the betrayal coming, or things like that. Present narrator just kind of does these other,\none of these other two flavors, with adding a character who can address the reader directly\nin the same way the flashback does. All right, guys. We will, next week, jump into probably character\nfor a couple weeks. So we will see you then. Take care."}, "5": {"0": " BRANDON: I had a request out of my 15-person\nworkshop that I move world building up a little bit, because they're starting new stories\nand the world building comes up very early. I'm going to do world building for the next\ntwo weeks. Isaac, Mary Robinette is coming when? ISAAC: The 20th. BRANDON: The 20th, okay. We'll have this week and next week on world\nbuilding. We'll then have Mary Robinette come and talk\nto you about short stories. Then we'll do the Q&A on world building, along\nwith some prose stuff the next week, and then we'll do the two weeks of character after\nthat. All right? That's kind of our format going forward. World building, I usually do about two lectures\non this, and today writer going to do the lecture on Sanderson's Laws. STUDENTS: Yay! BRANDON: This is very fun for me to do, because\nAsimov has laws, right? Clark has at least one. I figured I should have laws named after me,\nso I did it. Let me give you some background to what Sanderson's\nLaws are and how they came about. Sanderson's Laws started when I was working\non Mistborn, the first book. I finished Mistborn 1, and I turned it in\nand was working on Mistborn 2, and as Mistborn 1 was coming out, I started to realize that\nI felt like I'd done something wrong in Mistborn 1. Something wasn't working with the ending the\nway I wanted it to. I try to avoid too much in the way of spoilers,\nbut what happens in the first Mistborn book is, we were at the climax. The ending was happening. Everything was going well. I wrote it. I sent it to my editor. He wrote back and he's like, \"I feel like\nthis needs a little extra oomph. There's something missing here.\" I thought, huh, what could I do to give it\na little extra oomph. I thought, well, I've got this whole plot\nwhere Vin is going to start learning to use the mist to power allomancy a little bit,\nbecause it's foreshadowing for some stuff we need in book three. I thought, well, I'll just move that forward\nto this climax that allowed some new and interesting thing. Remember, this was the first book I ever wrote\nknowing it was going to be published. Even though I'd written 14 novels by this\ntime, I still was pretty much a newbie. I'd never done a lot of these things before. This was the first time that I'd really worked\nwith an editor on a book as I was writing it. Elantris had been finished years before, and\nyes, I'd done a lot of editorial on this, but it was a new experience working on Mistborn\n1. So I did this. Moshe was like, \"Great. That works. Gives it the extra oomph I need.\" And we released the book. When the book was being read, I started getting\nfeedback, and I went and looked at it, and it really feels like I just added a new power\nto the main character at the 95% mark in the book, which is exactly what I did. Absolutely 100% what I did. I started to think about, a lot of people\nwill point at science fiction and fantasy, that they don't like it. One of the things that they will say about\nit, that I don't think is true, and is a bad reason to not like sci-fi/fantasy, is they'll\nbe like, \"Oh, the author can just have anything happen, and therefore your ending lacks any\nsort of conflict because the author can just make up a way to save them.\u201d Now, I'm totally okay if people don't like\nsci-fi/fantasy. It's a flavor of storytelling, and there's\nno right storytelling and wrong storytelling to like and dislike. You can dislike things. But I think this criticism doesn't actually\nwork, because any author in any story can do this no matter what the story is. It is not something that I think is actually\nmore prevalent in sci-fi/fantasy than any other story. Yes, in sci-fi/fantasy you can do what I mistakenly\ndid, which is invent a new power for a character late in the story, and therefore deflate a\nlittle bit of the satisfaction of the ending, because it involves the character using something\nyou didn't know they had access to in order to save the day. But you can just as easily write a romance\nwhere the primary tension is that Character A is nobility and Character B is a commoner\nand that's keeping them apart. You could have, at the 90% part, a long-lost\nuncle walk up and say, \"Oh, by the way, she's royalty. You guys can totally get married,\" and evaporate\nthe conflict. That's a sidestep of the actual conflict,\nbut you're solving it by putting a patch on it, the same way I kind of put a patch on\nMistborn in a way that wasn't satisfying. You can do that in a romance just as easily. Doesn't matter what the conflict is, you can,\nat the end of your story stick a patch on it that will be a resolution, but an unsatisfying\none.", "314": " Having fluency over this is really an important\nsort of storytelling mechanic. Since I am a writer of science fiction and\nfantasy, since I love fantasy, I framed my kind of rule I came up with for myself to\nhelp me understand why this problem existed and how I could avoid it in the future as\na kind of little scientific-y sort of thing. That's what I do write. I don't write science. I write scientific-y things. With some development, I kind of broke this\nout themed toward building a magic system in a fantasy book, because I realized some\nother things about it. I'm going to write the first law up here. You can find these online, though. Isaac, I believe the essays are broken on\nmy website right now. We've gotten emails saying that people can't\nread them there. We will get them up and fixed. But Sanderson's First Law, and I apologize\nin advance for my handwriting. This is one where I actually want you to read\nit, so I will try to write so that you can. Your ability to solve problems with magic\nin a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the\nreader understands said magic. All right. This is a technical way of explaining what\nI just told you a story about. Your ability to solve problems with magic\nin a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic. This is something I thought about a long time,\nhow to phrase this in a way, because I was understanding something about my fiction that\nI hadn't before. I had known that deus ex machina is a bad\nthing. If you're not familiar with this phrase it\nmeans god from the machine. Am I right on that? It's an old Greek term for when they would\nhave the god save the characters at the end of a play because basically there was no other\nway to get out of the problem. We use it in modern storytelling to mean the\nauthor inventing a mechanism by which the characters are saved from the consequences\nof their actions in the late part of the story. Inventing new magical abilities in the late\npart of your story in order to get your characters out of problems will often feel unsatisfying\nfor the same reason. However, there's another story that goes along\nwith this, and this was when I was at my very first Worldcon as a participating professional\nauthor. This would have been in Boston, so whenever\nthe Boston Worldcon was, around 2004-2005. I sat on a panel at a big science fiction\nconvention. I'd been going to these for a while. I was really excited to sit on this panel. I was put on a panel called How Does the Magic\nWork. How do we use magic? I thought, this is perfect. This is my thing. I love magic systems. I love interesting magic systems. I am ready to go. So we got on the panel, there was me and a\ngroup of other people, and the moderator looked down the line and said, \"All right. We'll just start off with what is your go-to,\nfundamental thing you think about when building a magic system?\" I thought I could just really knock this one\nout of the park. They asked me to go first. I said, \"Well, obviously, a magic system needs\nto have rules.\" I think I picked this one up from Orson Scott\nCard's book. I think he talks about it. But either way, it was something that I just\nhad fundamentally believed. A good magic system is a magic system with\nrules. I thought I was really just using the easy,\nsoftball answer that would get the conversation rolling. But the other people on the panel looked to\nme and said, \"No! If you put rules on your magic you ruin it.\" I was shocked that the next half hour of our\ndiscussion was me arguing with these three other people, where I was like, \"No, no, no. This is foundational to building a magic system.\" This was like you had just told me that one\nplus one does not equal two. I was flabbergasted that I had to argue this. But through that discussion I actually started\nto realize my way of doing it was not the only way to do it, and in fact, a lot of the\nstories I liked didn't explain the rules of the magic to me, and maybe didn't even have\nrules that the author relied upon. I thought, well, how is this working then? So I started to build this second sort of\nphilosophy about magic, which is that there is, the way I see it, a kind of continuum,\na sliding scale that you can be on. On one side is a sense of wonder about the\nmagic specifically, and on the other side is problem solving with magic, or magic as\nscience. Now, don't take this as law, because I bet\nthere are people who are able to do both. But generally what happens is as you move\ntoward solving problems with magic and your magic working more like a science, you move\naway from a sense of wonder or mystery to that magic. It's very natural sort of thing. The more you explain about something, the\nmore it moves to a different emotion and understanding in you. As I became a writer, my intersection with\nmovies and books that I read changed. Instead of being in this sort of, \"Wow, how\ndid they do this?\" I moved into, \"Oh, I see what they're doing. That's cool.\" Those two emotions were kind of different\nemotions. I can be in awe of a story that's pulled off\nwell, because I know exactly how hard it is to do. But I'm no longer mystified about how the\nauthor accomplished that. It's kind of this same sort of thing. I'm not sure if sense of wonder is the exact\nright phrase, but I think you can get the idea. What's going on here is, as you move this\ndirection, you're able to solve problems in a satisfying way with your magic. What does this mean? Why am I saying this? Well, if you give your characters some tools,\nand then get to watch the characters use those tools to escape problems and to solve problems\nand escape situations, then you as a reader will feel really satisfied about that. It's why my kids, when they were young, loved\nto watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse was it? Where they're like, \"Here are the three tools\nthat we are going to need today.\" They set up, \"Here are your three tools,\"\nand then as they go along it's like, \"Oh, one of our tools is a jack. Oh, our car broke down. Which of our three tools do we use?\" Now, you do a more complicated version of\nthis in your stories, but it's essentially the same thing. You are going to set up, here are the tools\nthe character has. This character is able to teleport through\nwalls. This character is able to drink a potion that\nturns them into looking like someone else. This character has this ability. Then you are going to, on this side of the\nmagic, rely on the character's quick wits to apply that tool to different situations. It's a little bit like the heist archetype\nthat I talked to you about a couple weeks ago, where you can take a certain archetype\nwhere you give someone a group of tools, they work on it, and then they rearrange them to\nuse them in different ways at the end. That's the sort of thing you're doing with\na rule-based magic system. But it's not the only type of magic out there. In fact, there are a lot of magics where they're\nsearching for something else, and in this case, it's a magic you don't know what it's\ngoing to do. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse they had a mystery\ntool. \"We don't know what this is. It'll solve a problem eventually.\" The mystery tool, or even things more mysterious,\nhappen a lot in fantasy books, and it doesn't mean they're bad magic systems. In fact, some of the best magic systems use\nwhat I would call a soft magic, as opposed to a hard magic. A soft magic is you don't know the consequences\nor even really the cost of using the magic, and you are not certain you can predict what\nthe ramifications or effects will be. Most of the time, the viewpoint protagonist\nis not the one using the magic, or if they are, it is a type of device that they are\nusing, or some sort of magical thing that they can't predict the consequences. The Monkey's Paw story is a nice little hybrid\nstory that's a little bit sense of wonder. It's on the sense of wonder side. You know you can make a wish, but you don't\nknow what the consequences of that wish will be, and the emotion that story's relying upon\nis that sense of wonder twisted on its head to a sense of horror. A lot of times, horror is twisting a positive\nemotion into a negative emotion in some way. Monkey's Paw, if you don't know this story,\npeople make wishes on this monkey's paw, and they always turn out awful and horrible and\nfrightening. As the book progresses you see the escalation\nof the wishes that are getting made and things like this, and it's just a brilliant story. It is using a soft magic with just a little\nbit of an edge toward, so you understand what the characters can do, but they cannot control\nconsequences. That sort of story, that sort of magic can\nmake fantastic stories. I'll give you two examples of stories that\nuse both a hard magic and a soft magic in the same story, and you can see how the contrast\nof the two is very effective. The first of these is Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings uses for the ring what I\nwould call a magic that is toward the magic as science with the ring. It's still that one step away toward the sense\nof wonder, or in this case also horror, because you're not exactly sure what the ultimate\nconsequences of using the ring are, and you're not exactly sure what Sauron can do with that\nring. You just know it's bad. But most of the storytelling mechanics of\nthe ring do a couple of things. What does the ring do? It turns you invisible. Yep. It turns you invisible and expands your lifespan. What are the costs? Sauron sees you and you turn into Gollum. Right? Basically these are the things. The enemy can find you and you turn into Gollum. Tolkien is very wise to put in the story example\nof Gollum showing you exactly what the consequences are. That is a story that's very good at showing\nyou, look, if Frodo keeps this ring he turns into this thing. It's right here on screen. It's actually a very hard magic system as\nmagic systems go. Every time Frodo is using it, you can judge. He's going to turn invisible, but here are\nthe consequences. Lo and behold, in the story those consequences\nare usually pretty dire, but they're anticipatable. It's repeatable. It's following the scientific method. And the reader now knows the tool Frodo has\nand the costs of that tool. What can Gandalf do? STUDENTS: (Calling out several indistinct\nanswers) BRANDON: Yes. Now, I'm not asking the people who have read\nall the back material, which does move Gandalf", "1074": " a little bit more toward the middle. But in the books, Gandalf is pretty much all\nthe way over here. You know Gandalf has power and can do stuff. You're not sure what it is. And a lot of times when he even uses his powers\nhe's offscreen. He fights the Balrog offscreen, purposefully\nin the books. You're not sure what's going on. You don't know what he's doing. You know it will have huge consequences. And lo and behold the huge consequences are\nhe dies and gets resurrected as Gandalf the White. You're not sure how that worked, why that\nworked, the consequences. You might say, \"Wait a minute. That feels like it's removing consequences\nfrom the characters.\" But that's not the purpose of Gandalf's magic. Gandalf's magic is not-- Gandalf is not a\ntactical nuke that you're using in a specific place for a specific purpose. Gandalf is there to make sure that the Hobbits\nfeel small, both metaphorically and literally. That's the whole point of having Hobbits in\nthe story. Tolkien was a student of the classic epics. He did a translation of Beowulf once. If you want to have fun, then go read Beowulf\nand compare it to the Hobbit. It very much felt like he wanted to write\none of these ancient heroic epics but put a normal person in the role of the hero. Instead of Beowulf we get Frodo or Bilbo. In order to emphasize that, though he gives\nFrodo a power that's a hard magic power, he makes sure Gandalf exists in the story to\nindicate this is a world of magic that is much, much bigger than anything the Hobbits\ncan comprehend, and you as readers don't need to comprehend it. These two magics work perfectly in this book\nhand in hand, giving both a sense of grandness and wonder, and giving a tool to the main\ncharacter that he can use at certain times in clever ways to escape problems and situations,\nand then to have to pay for that later on at the climactic moment of the stories, where\nindeed, the costs that he has been paying come due. Another great example of this is Name of the\nWind by Patrick Rothfuss. One of the reasons Name of the Wind works\nso well, I won't speak about this as much, is that he also has a hard magic and a soft\nmagic, and by including both of those he is able to contrast. If you haven't read the books, he is going\nto a magic school, and one of the things they do is build magical devices using sympathetic\nmagic. It's a type of magic that people believed\nworked in our world, that like affects like, that actually works in his world. The rules, it gets a little soft in there,\nbut mostly it's like, you do this, you get this. You do this, you get this. Meanwhile, there's a professor at the school\nwho studies a different type of magic. This magic is the naming of things. This magic is explained as very powerful,\nvery mysterious, and likely to drive you crazy. Of course, the main character is drawn to\nthis naming magic in the same way that a moth is to a flame, and that's part of the tension\nof the story is, is he going to suffer the consequences that this professor has by delving\ninto naming magic, which the naming magic is there to reinforce this story being about\na poet and a musician and talking about a magic that is more like poetry and music. You can't define it. There is engineering class in his magic school,\nand there's poetry class. Yes, he can figure out engineering class,\nbut he wants to go to poetry because you can't quantify poetry. The two work very well in a scholarly setting\nas kind of showing off these two different disciplines and the contrast between them\nin these two stories. You do not need to have both in your books. In fact, most books only have one.", "1304": " I will say that you don't have to be all the\nway to one side or the other. In fact, usually it's very handy to be right\nabout here with even your hard magics, so that you have the mystery tool, so that later\non if you're writing a series you can expand the magic and leave some mystery in the first\nbook that can later on be explored and explained. The further my books go, because I tend to\nbe pretty far on that side, the more the magic gets explained, and the more the holes that\nI've introduced in the magic intentionally in the start, start to get filled in. This is how you actually have, like, the ending\nof Mistborn 1 could still work. Because Sanderson's First Law is really a\nlaw of foreshadowing. If I had spent the whole first book saying,\n\"There were some Mistborn sometimes who were able to do something really weird and we don't\nknow how, and we think it might involve this. And here's this apparent contradiction in\nthe magic system that we think should work, but we don't know why.\" And then later on those things are reconciled,\nand the character figures something out and is then able to access the magic, that would\nwork. In fact, most Asimov Three Law stories are\nthis way. If you haven't read Asimov's Three Laws, he's\ngot three laws of robotics, this, this. And then a robot is acting weird. It's running around in a big circle instead\nof doing what it's supposed to do. What's up? Well, let's go look at how the three laws\ninteract with one another and we'll find out why this robot's programming has a bug that\nis causing a contradiction between the three laws, and therefore they're acting this way. That is kind of one of Asimov's go-to storytelling\ndevices. Of course, he also has the \"robots develop\nsome weird sense of wonder thing, we don't like it, so we destroy it.\" So he does have sense of wonder stories as\nwell.", "1414": " This is the Law of Foreshadowing. The reason I say, \"in a satisfying way,\" I\nwant to point out before we do questions about this one, is sometimes you don't want to solve\nproblems in a satisfying way because you are doing something else with this scene. The example I often use for this is, you've\nprobably seen a lot of stories where the characters in the first third of the story get into desperate\nsituation, there is no way out of it, and then out of nowhere someone comes and saves\nthem. Probably seen a lot of this. It's done all the time in Hollywood films. Why is this done? Usually to introduce this new character. That's one of the things. You're like, we want to have a dramatic introduction\nto this character. We will have them save the other characters\nand show off their cool abilities in Act 1 when the characters couldn't possibly have\nsurvived. There are other reason that narratives do\nthis. Some of them are kind of lame, I'll admit. Some of them are quite legitimate. Introducing a character in Act 1 to save the\nday is very different from having an unnamed character show up in Act 3 to save you at\nthe end. Han works because it's foreshadowed. But Han, if he showed up in the first part\nof the story, could just show up and save them. Be like, \"Oh, yeah, this is my friend Han. Now you know how cool he is.\" Understand that these are all tools. There's not wrong ways to do this. In fact, Sanderson's Laws, I call them laws\nbecause it sounds cool, and that's basically the format that people use, but they are not\nlaws for you. You don't have to follow these. These are rules I made for myself to tell\nthe types of stories I want to tell, to get the type of effect that I want to get, and\nthey might be helpful for you to understand some sort of narrative things about using\nyour magic systems in a story. So let me ask, any questions about Sanderson's\nFirst Law? Yeah. STUDENT: This could be spoilers, but the end\nof Oathbringer. BRANDON: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. CLASS: (groans)\nSTUDENT: And how that works. I guess it doesn't have to be that specific\nexample, but how do you make it an ending that is both satisfying and doesn't follow\nthat? BRANDON: When I'm talking about this, when\nI'm doing this right, the goal is that I am foreshadowing that something can and will\nhappen, and that you could have figured out what was going to happen before it happens. Now, I might not always get this right. It'll depend on your own personal read. But when Sanderson's First Law is working\nfor me, it is you could have known and figured out what was going to happen at the end ahead\nof time. With Oathbringer, I would argue the answer\nwas coming down to a character's decision. You didn't know which way they were going\nto decide, but you knew they could decide either way. The emphasis is, if they decide one way something\nhappens, and if they decide another way, something happens. The setup for this is very different based\non situation. Let me explain. I've got a good story for you to explain this. The story is the two Lord of the Rings films,\nmovie two and movie three. Now, movie two of the three is my favorite\nof the Lord of the Rings films, and part of this has to do with the defense of Helm's\nDeep. Now, in this story, what happens is characters\ngo to Helm's Deep to defend it against an Orc, Orci, whatever, invasion. They know that this is kind of one of their\nlast stands. They are in serious trouble. The setup ahead of time is, Gandalf says to\nthem something. You guys remember what it is? STUDENT: \"Look for me the morning of the third\nday.\" BRANDON: \"Look for me the morning of the third\nday,\" is that what he says? Fifth day. \"Look for me the morning of the fifth day.\" What's that? You watched it last night? \u201cLook for me at the morning of the fifth\nday. Look for me, and he rides off.\u201d The setup for that situation is, if we survive\nfive days, Gandalf will save us. Now, the narrative does everything it can\ndo to make you forget that, by showing you how terrible the situation is, by making them\nfight to the very end of their wits, and their strength, and their exhaustion. They are basically defeated. But at the end they go out for a final charge,\nand then the sun rises, and then it plays Gandalf's \"Look for me on the morning of the\nfifth day,\" and Gandalf appears. They see him, and then an army comes up behind\nhim. Now you've seen this army leave, so the pieces\nwere there, but the setup for the characters was not \"You need to defeat these Orcs or\nelse.\" The setup is, \"If you survive this amount\nof time, you are okay.\" In the third movie, this setup is not done\nthe same way. They are defending Minas Tirith. It is set up as, \"If we don't protect Minas\nTirith, we are doomed.\" And then Aragorn goes off to ghosts. And then as they're about to fall, Aragorn\nshows up with the ghosts and saved them. On a kind of strict outline basis, these two\nare the same. Yet in the Aragorn saving them with the ghosts,\nI felt just really kind of let down. I'm like, \"Oh, okay. I guess they're okay. It's still a great film. Yeah, whatever.\" And in the middle film, every time Gandalf\ncomes up over that ledge as I'm watching it, I can barely keep the emotion in. When the light comes down behind him and the\nOrcs are like \"Aaugh!\" It's just beautiful. Every time when Aragorn shows up with the\nghosts I'm like, \"All right, we're done having fun with Gimli and Legolas bantering about\nwho killed what. We're done with this. Okay, we're done. So I would ask you, why do I have such a different\nemotional reaction to number three than I do to number two? This is about promises and payoffs. In both the Tolkien, or actually this is Jackson,\nbecause they don't happen exactly the same", "1807": " way in the books, in both of these Jackson\nis solving a problem with an external force that is protecting the characters from the\nconsequences that are coming toward them. But in one of them, they are promised if they\ncan do this, they will receive this. In the other, they are promised, \"You need\nto survive. Oh, you didn't? Okay, we'll just save you anyway.\" Now, it is obviously much better done than\nthat, because it's a fantastic film, even the third one. But when I am looking for this to work, it's\nnot necessarily that you need to understand exactly what the magic can do. You need to understand what the setup is. For instance, a lot of stories will say, \"I\nfeel like if I can solve this problem with the magic I will receive a dump of understanding\nabout everything that will let me save the day.\" If you have set that up for the reader, if\nthey figure out this problems and then that happens, the reader will be fine. They're like, \"Yes! This is exactly what I was promised.\" I\nf they fail to figure that thing out, they fail to make the decision, they fail to achieve\nwhat you've set up in your narrative for them to do, and then they still succeed, well,\nthen you're going to need some other way to make that work, and you totally can. But in that case, that's where Sanderson's\nFirst Law is not really applied, if that makes sense. Again, I'm not perfect at this. So you can totally read one of my books and\nsay, \"You know, Sanderson, I don't think you completely pulled it off. I don't think you did the setup the right\nway I needed to for this ending to work.\" But this is what I'm trying to do, if that\nmakes any sense. And that story helps me kind of explain how\nI view this. Other questions about this? STUDENT: In regards to setup, how do you explain\nyour magic in an exciting way without info", "1914": " dumping? BRANDON: Yes. How do you avoid the dreaded info dump? Did I tell you guys last week what I was doing\nwith the Mistborn screenplay? I told the little class, didn't I. I didn't\ntell you guys. I'm writing the Mistborn screenplay right\nnow. CLASS: (oohing and ahing)\nBRANDON: Ah! Yes. Ah! STUDENT: How close is it? BRANDON: How close is it? It's not that close. Basically, me writing the screenplay is not\nwhat you want to have happen. It means that I've given up on Hollywood writing\nthe screenplay. I'm just going to do it myself. I am not an expert screenwriter. I've only written one screenplay before in\nmy life, so this will be number two. So I'll need a lot of help to even make it\nwork. But fortunately I have some good help from\nsome friends in Hollywood who are very good at screenplays, who are giving me advice,\nand I've done some brainstorming sessions with them. So I am approaching how to do this. One of the things I ran into is in the book,\nthis isn't too much of a spoiler for the book, in the book, Kelsior takes Vin, Kelsior's\nthe mentor figure, Vin is learning the magic, out into the mist to explain how the magic\nsystem works. In a book it actually works pretty well. It's like, instead of sitting down in the\nclassroom, he takes her out and says, \"All right, let's try this and experiment with\nthis.\" She's like, \"All right. We'll try this magic power. We'll try this magic power.\" That alone takes it away, takes it several\nsteps. One thing you could do is include an encyclopedia\nentry on the magic you're doing. That's your worst choice. Choice number two is to have the characters\nsit and talk about the magic and get it explained. That's still a pretty bad choice, but at least\nit's moved to dialogue. Choice number three is, let's go out and experiment\nand having problems making it work, and the teacher instructing them. That works pretty well in the book. In the screenplay I don't have time for that,\nand it would work less well on screen. So what did I do is I combined that scene\nand the scene also early in the book where Kelsior sneaks into House Venture to steal\na bead of atium. In the movie version, these were the same\nscene. Vin's followed him. She's like, \"You promised to train me.\" He's like, \"All right, baptism by fire. Come with me and we're going to try these\ndifferent things while we're robbing these people.\" So by overlapping those scenes, suddenly there's\nway more tension to \"Now you've got to learn to do this, and if you don't, that guard is\ngoing to alert us, and we'll all be in trouble.\" And when she screws up he can help out and\nthings, but now there's a tension to the scene. And the scene combines two scenes and it gets\nway more active and interesting because the reader's like, or I guess in this case really\nthe viewer's like, \"Oh, now there's some real consequences on the line to this same sort\nof project.\" The same thing is happening, practice, same\nsort of practice, same thing is happening as happened in the book, but in a situation\nwith increased tension. That is also a good way to make sure this\nhappens. Now, you have to balance that. Because one of the things you risk when you're\nbring this into a tense scene is that the reader might get lost and confused while and\naction sequence is happening, which is generally a bad idea. Fortunately, on film I have all the ability\nto visualize a lot of this, so I don't have to explain it in the same way as I do in a\nbook, which makes that scene work. One of the biggest challenges to writing science\nfiction and fantasy is how you get across your world building elements in a way that\nis not boring. To do this you need to construct your scenes\ndeliberately, in a way that gives you a chance to not just show the magic working, but to\nshow character and setting details while you are explaining the magic in some way. In fact, the point of the scene might be to\nexplain the magic, but your emphasis in the scene should be making sure the character\nis interesting and you're showing as much or more about the character as you are about\nthe magic, or at least you are providing excitement equivalent to that. Try to do multiple things at once, and make\nsure you are keeping your focus on the character. All right? Okay. Let's move on to Sanderson's Second Law. All right. Sanderson's Second Law comes about because\nI was sitting and thinking about powers that I put in my books. This one also kind of relates a little bit\nto Mistborn. I was at a book signing at one point. I spent a lot of time thinking about, what\nare new powers? What are new things I can put in my books\nthat are going to be different? Someone came to me at a book signing once\nand said, \"Hey, I love Mistborn. It's like a whole book full of Magnetos.\" And I'm like, \"Wait. Oh, wait, that's just basically Magneto, isn't\nit?\" Like what are Mistborn? You take Magneto, you mash them together with\n\"these are not the droids you're looking for because they can manipulate emotions,\" and\nyou've basically got Mistborn. I was like, \"Oh, wow, am I a hack?\" As a writer, expect that question to pop up\nin your head frequently. \"Oh, no, am I a hack?\" The answer is no, you're not, because I don't\neven really like that term. If you are seeking to write stories the way\nthat you would want to read them and enjoy in your stories, you are not a hack. But there's this thing of, \"Am I original? I thought I was original, and now I realize\nI'm not.\" Well, that's a completely different story. You are probably going to worry you're not\noriginal too much, because the end of the day, the most original thing you can add to\na story is your perspective, and that is unique to you. Now, the more you write, the more you will\nrealize how to not be derivative. Because when you start off you will be derivative,\nand that is generally a problem and something you want to avoid. The more you write, the more you'll learn\nto put your own stamp on things. But generally, experienced writers worry about\nbeing derivative well past when it's not even a consideration for you at all. Okay? If you're worried about it, see if some early\nreaders say you are. Learn how to tweak things to make them your\nown a little bit more. Sanderson's Laws might help you. But don't stress this as much as perhaps you\nmight. But what I realized is, I'm like, \"Well, how\ndid I come up with allomancy? Why did allomancy work? Why did I enjoy it so much?\" One of the things I landed on was this idea\nthat allomancy, if you haven't read the books, you can push on pieces of metal and they'll\nfling you up in the air. Basically, if something's heavier than you\nare, if it's attached to the floor and you push on it you go the other direction. It's vector physics used as a fun magic system. If you push on a coin it flies away from you,\nbut if it hits something heavier than you, then you'll launch backward. Equal and opposite reaction, right? This was really fun to write. Why? Because of Sanderson's First Law sort of stuff. Making the character stretch with the tools\nthey have rather than solving the problems externally was a real blast to write and it\nmade this writing more exciting, more interesting to me, thinking how can I use this tool in\na way the reader's not expecting but they could have anticipated is very fun to me. So I spent a lot of time in that space. I realized, though, that allomancy is just\na really lame form of flying. Like, if you could fly, then that would just\nbe strictly better than launching off of something. If you had full telekinesis, you could just\nmove things around wherever you wanted, that'd just be a better version of allomancy. And yet I've read books with that, and the\nmagic systems have been less fun. So why is that? And that was kind of Sanderson's Second Law. Sanderson's Second Law is that flaws or limitations\nare more interesting than powers. Doesn't mean that the powers aren't interesting. Like the question of \"What if you could do\nthis?\" is a great story starter. What if you could fly? Where would you go with that? But in developing a magic system, building\nin the flaws and limitations, and I'll say", "2409": " costs, is generally more interesting and creates\nmore storytelling potential than the powers themselves. For instance, if I said to you, \"You can fly,\"\nthat might send you along some interesting paths in telling a story. If I said, \"You can fly, but only as long\nas your parents are both sleeping.\" Then suddenly you're like, \"Oh!\" It's a very different story, right? This suddenly takes us into a different direction. \"Do my parents both need to be alive? But they both need to be asleep? Do I now move to the opposite side of the\nworld so I can consistently be a, during the day when they are sleeping?\" Or come up with whatever, fly. You can have the classic, like what is the\none that Scott Card uses in his book. You can use the magic, but if you do, one\nof your living relatives will be killed. Suddenly, that's what the story is about. The Wheel of Time has a great example of this. All these mystical, wonderful powers, but\nthe more you use them, the more likely you are to become insane and kill everyone you\nlove. In fact, we start with the prologue showing\nsomeone who has gone crazy and killed everyone they love, so you understand the stakes and\nconsequences right from the get-go, which was a brilliant move. It's the same thing as putting Gollum in your\nstory so you can see what the character will become. But the flaws and limitations and the costs\nare where generally your story happens. Superman has classically been a very difficult\ncharacter for people to do films about. We had one and a half really great Superman\nfilms, and then we've had several films that have had really great parts, but the authors\nof the films have struggled with making those Superman films click with audiences. And this kind of comes down to the fact that\npeople are like, Superman has too much power. It's too hard to write a story. And yet I watched as a young man an entire\nseries about Superman that I loved, and I still think is really fun, even though it's\na '90s show, so it's way campy. That's Lois and Clark. You'll see that Superman works really well\non the small screen. There have been adaptation after adaptation\nof Superman or Supergirl that have been really fun stories to tell, and that generally is\nbecause the people telling the small scale story have such limited special effects budgets\nthat they can't make a big spectacle of Superman punching someone harder than that person can\npunch, and so they have to say, \"Well, what else can we do?\" And Superman stories generally fall into one\nof three categories. The first one is what I just said. Someone has shown up who can punch harder\nthan Superman. Oh, no! That's where the movies tend to go a lot. What is the other Superman story? Somebody has kryptonite. Oh, no, I don't have my powers anymore. What is story number three? I am unable to use my powers effectively to\nsolve this problem. Either someone who is weaker than me is in\ndanger so my powers, now they don't have the powers, or, I would really like this person\nto fall in love with me. My powers don't give me that ability, except\nat the end of the second film, which is why there's one and a half good Superman films. Or I guess now that's the kiss of forgetfulness. But you know what I mean. But Superman II has some goofy super H stuff\nin it. I still love it, but it has some goofy super\nH. Okay, story time. Early in my career, this has nothing to do\nwith anything, early in my career, I was guest of honor at a con up in, like, North Salt\nLake or something, and they're like, \"The local news station wants to have you on the\nnews on the morning show.\" I'm like, \"Wow, this is really cool. I've never been on the news before. That's great.\" They're like, \"Yeah, but they're going to\ninvite several other people, and you're all going to be on TV.\" I'm like brand new. I'm like, \"Be on TV!\" So I show up and who's going to be on? It's me and Ursa, the Superman II villain,\nthe one that's a woman, and a group of Storm Troopers. And the notice thing was us just standing\nthere, and they're like, \"Look at these weirdos at this science fiction convention. You should go meet them.\" It was actually a fine experience, but I'm\nlike, \"Wow, my now claim to fame is being on TV with the villain from Superman II. Not that one, not that one, but that one,\nand some Storm Troopers.\" Somewhere, someone has that clip of me standing\nthere awkwardly, being like, \"Oh, yeah, I guess we are the weird-- the zoo has come\nto town and we wear Storm Trooper armor.\" She was very nice, by the way. But that's neither here nor there. The stories that people look to tell about\nSuperman I think are instructive to us because generally they are looking to tell stories\nabout things that Superman's powers don't really influence. In fact, my favorite episode that I remember\nof Lois and Clark was, like, there was this robot who had kryptonite. They're like, \"We're powering it by kryptonite\nso if it punches Superman it'll take away all his powers.\" But the whole rest of that story, this robot's\nhere, he's dealing with something with Lois, which is really interesting and engaging,\nbecause it's character relationship stuff, and his powers come into play almost not at\nall. They do this, they have this thing, and at\nthe end of the episode they're like, \"Oh, yeah, you have to go fight this robot.\" He's like, \"Oh, right, I can fly, and I have\nlaser vision.\" So he flies up and he lasers the thing and\nthen he flies away, and it takes, like, 10 seconds. That is writers who understood that Superman\npunching harder than something is not as interesting as the fact that he has galactic-scale godlike\npowers but can't interact with the human world. He's still just a nerd who can't make relationships\nwork. That's why that show worked. Now, what does this have to do with? Well, when you're developing your magic, naturally\na lot of your stories are going to err toward conflict. So they are going to err toward one of these\nkind of three stories. Either the character is not skilled enough\nwith their magic yet and needs to level up. Or, they need to find something that's not\nworking in the magic and fix it so that they can then use their magic the correct way. Or, the magic is not working right now. \"What do I do?\" Or, the magic can't solve this problem. It can maybe help me with the surrounding\nthings, but I need to then find a way to solve this problem using my other attributes, not\njust my magic. Those are going to be your three paradigms\nfor telling stories about the magic. there are others. But those are kind of the three catchalls. All of those deal with this idea of your flaws\nand your limitations are a big part of why those stories are working. I view these three things as three different\nthings, and I also, they're just my definitions that I talk about. But I also view them as kind of larger storytelling\nrules, just like the first one's really rule", "2826": " of foreshadowing. This is kind of about your characters also. Your character's flaws and their limitations,\nand the things they're willing to do and not willing to do, and the costs of certain actions,\nare where your stories are going to happen about your characters. Flaws, basically, are things the character\ncould change, or the magic you don't understand yet, and with more application of effort or\ncharacter change, you will be able to fix. For instance, I will see a flaw as, in Elantris\nthe whole story is about a flaw in the magic. The magic stopped working 10 years ago. We don't know why. People used to get divine powers. Now they get cursed for eternity, and they\nbecome zombies. The whole story revolves around there's a\nflaw in the magic and we don't know what it is. Something's broken. That flaw is what I build my whole story on. But in a lot of stories there's also this\nflaw of, we don't understand this part of the magic. Or, you are not good enough at the magic yet\nto do what you need to do. You need to practice. If they character applies themself, if the\npeople apply themselves, there is a solution to this problem somewhere in the narrative. Same sort of thing with the characterization\nthing. A flaw in your character is your character\ndoesn't trust people. Your character has good reasons for not trusting\npeople, but they really need to learn to trust their thieving crew, because these guys are\nactually good. Through the course of the story, you are going\nto learn to trust again so that you can actually have a relationship with this guy you're falling\nin love with. That is Mistborn's theme. There's a flaw in the character. That doesn't mean, again, the character is\nresponsible for that flaw. Sometimes life has beaten people down. But it is something you can work on and fix.", "2932": " A limitation is different for me, both for\na character and a magic system. The limitation of allomancy is you can push\nand pull only directly away from yourself or directly toward yourself, center of gravity,\nor center or mass, or whatever. The narrative is now making you think, the\ncharacter's need to figure a way to fix this problem. It's just a limitation of the magic. You work with it rather than you try to fix\nit. For a characterization, a limitation might\nbe something like, you were born with one arm. The narrative, you could imagine narrative\nwhere this character's on a quest to get a robotic arm or something, but most narratives\nare like, you've been born with one arm, you want to play in the NFL, you have a limitation\nyou're going to have to work with. There's nothing to fix. It's not that if only you'd been a better\nperson you wouldn't have one arm instead of two? But that's not the theme of the narrative. The narrative is about this person who has\na handicap needs to work within this handicap in order to achieve what they want to do. Magic systems are the same way. The magic system has this handicap, this limitation. You're going to work with it.", "3005": " And then cost. Cost doesn't play as well with character as\nit does with magic. It's just kind of a good rule of thumb to\nask yourself what is your magic cost. But you can also deal with this in character\nby saying, if character takes this action, what is the cost to them emotionally, physically,\nmentally, these sorts of things? You can set up that if character makes this\ndecision it's going to be very difficult for them and cost them something, and that's really\ngood tension. The same way with the magic system. The magic system where if you have this magical\npower, but every time you use it one of your next of kin dies, that is a really steep cost. You can vary these costs depending on how\nmuch you want the magic to be used and what the role of the cost is in the magic. A lot of times, and this is just fine, but\na lot of times magic systems will write one of the costs as being equivalent to the bullets\nin a gunslinger's gun. It costs using this resource, and the character\nwill run out of it when it's dramatically appropriate that they do. STUDENT: Stormlight. BRANDON: Stormlight, that sort of thing. Very common to use a cost like that with the\nmagic. The reason that those sorts of costs are fun\nis because they can have narrative tension, but also you usually can tie them into the\neconomy really interestingly, and you have a legitimate reason if you want to tell story\nnumber two, character doesn't have their powers. You don't have to invent a reason why they\ndon't have their powers. You just deny them the resource, and now getting\nthe resource can become part of the narrative, where you can set up your story as, \"If we\ncan get this stuff, then I can solve the problem.\" And of course, you're really telling, generally,\nin those cases, a different story about the character's story, and the getting the stuff\njust becomes a McGuffin for the plot. But it leads to a very useful method of being\nable to tell versions of story number two with the magic. But it also can tie things into economics,\nand you can add a social dimension to it in that case where rich characters are able to\nuse the magic more. Wow, theme! There's all sorts of things there. But you can also come up with very strict\ncosts, which themselves can be really fascinating stories. You have three wishes. You're going to make all three wishes, but\nthey're all going to go wrong, horribly wrong in some way. Go. Well, okay, we have a very strongly limited\nmagic that also is leading to a horror story.", "3142": " You can vary the cost to depend on how you\nwant your story to go. But a lot of times your story is going to\nbe about your flaws, limitation, and cost, either in character or in the magic system. Any questions about rule number two? STUDENT: With limitations, like not being\ngood enough, how do you do a story about that, which is something about, like, they don't\nhave enough in the story? BRANDON: It depends on the type of story you\nwant to tell. It kind of depends on the character arc the\ncharacter is on. If the character arc is, you need to get better\nat this, I frame it in the story as a flaw, not a limitation. I narratively structure it out, if the character\nwill do X, Y, and Z, they will overcome this ignorance they have and be able to succeed. Usually you tell these stories in the \"I showed\nup to fight Darth Vader, and guess what happened? I lost my hand and now my entire world is\nshot. I'm going to go train some more so that next\ntime I can fight Darth Vader, and I'm going to train in a way that isn't just about battling\nthe sword. I'm going to train in a way that I use the\nrevelation.\" That third movie works because a flaw has\nbeen overcome in Luke where he realizes that just slamming his light saber against Darth\nVader is not the way to win that battle. But it could also be couched as a limitation. I used this one in The Rithmatist. In The Rithmatist, certain people have magic,\ncertain people don't, and someone who loves the magic doesn't have it. The story is framed as a \"You aren't going\nto get this thing, because unfortunately life isn't fair and the people who might be really\ngood at something sometimes just aren't born into the privileged situation where they can\nuse it, like you weren't. So let's find a way that you work with that\nlimitation that is satisfying.\" That story is not about the character overcoming\na flaw. It is working with a limitation. I tell very different climaxes for those two\nstories, even though they're basically about the same thing. That would be my response to you. What do you want the character's journey to\nbe? What do you want your climax to look like? How do you want your stand-up-and-cheer moment,\nor your sit-down-and-cry moment to feel? Yeah. STUDENT: I'd like your opinion on low costs\nthat make a character more quirky. BRANDON: Low costs that make a character more\nquirky? Do you have an example? STUDENT: For example, let's say Luke can use\nthe Force, which is obviously one thing, but say that you could throw in that he never\nloses in that space chess game. BRANDON: Right. Luke never loses in that space chess game. He's got a quirky-- So you're asking, can\nI give someone a power that doesn't really have much of a cost or limitation, but it's\njust there to be fun? Absolutely. In fact, it also depends on if you're looking\nfor-- like, that's doing something more like sense of wonder. You're characterizing with this thing, and\nyou're using it for humor, for emotion, and things like this, and not for problem solving,\nand in that case, great. You're going to run into a problem where if\nyour story then becomes about whether someone can win the big space chess game, and Luke\nisn't the person they choose to go play in that space chess tournament, that's where\nyou have problems. Sometimes you give someone these quirky powers,\nand then as the story progresses the readers start to ask more and more, \"Wait a minute. Why aren't the eagles flying them to--\" Right? There are explanations, but the fact that\na lot of people ask that question means that the explanations were not satisfyingly presented,\nand that was given, it's more a quirk of Gandalf. He knows the eagles. It's more a sense of wonder. But then those two things intersect, and people\nstart to ask. \"Wait a minute!\" And that's your problem with that. Does that make sense? All right. Let's go ahead and move on to rule number\nthree. There's three of these and a Zeroeth Law. All right, Law Number Three. Law Number Three comes from me when I was\nworking on trying to build the Stormlight Archive. Now, the history of the Stormlight Archive,\nif you're not familiar with it is, I think I told you guys about it before, but I wrote\nthe book in 2002 before I sold Elantris. This book, I failed in writing it. For those who haven't read the book, the Stormlight\nArchive is a large epic, full of a large cast of characters, with a very different world\nfrom ours. There is a lot of bringing people up to speed\non the world building. There's a very steep learning curve. There's a lot of information to get across. Plus, I wanted to do some big thing where\nI had tons of characters. I'd been reading The Wheel of Time. I'm like, \"There's so many characters. I want to do something like this.\" The first draft of Way of Kings was way too\nexpository, meaning I was just dumping information on you, and it started the character arcs\nof multiple different characters and didn't finish them, because the book, if I'm trying\nto do 10 character arcs or whatever it is I ended up doing, and I only got through 10%\nof each of them, instead of picking a couple characters and getting through their arcs. It made for a very unsatisfying book. But in 2007, a very large freight train called\nThe Wheel of Time smashed into me unexpectedly and carried me with it on a long journey that\nI had not been expecting mere days before. That changed my career dramatically. TOR, as I had finished up Warbreaker and turned\nit in, was like, \"What are you going to do next?\" I'm like, \"This feels like the right time\nto do Way of Kings, if I can fix it.\" So I sat down, and I rebuilt all the world\nbuilding from scratch, trying to improve it, trying to work with it, and I kept running\ninto this problem. You see, I would go to signings, and people\nknew that Mistborn had three different magic systems. That's part of what made Mistborn work. Book 1, if you haven't read them, focuses\non allomancy. Book 2 focuses on a different magic that's\nhinted at in the first book, and Book 3 focuses on a third magic that is hinted at in the\nfirst two books. You start to learn about the mechanics of\neach of them. It worked very well for the structure of that\nseries to dig into a different magic in each series so there was always something new to\nbe exploring. I didn't explain it all in the first book\nand left some sense of wonder for the future books. So people started to ask me, they learned\nabout the Way of Kings. They learned that I had written this book\nand hadn't released it, and they found an Amazon listing for it, somehow. I still don't know how this happened, by the\nway, because I never signed a contract for The Way of Kings. I signed a contract for Elantris and Mistborn. But initially, Moshe had offered on Elantris\nand The Way of Kings. So somehow, someone in TOR told Amazon this\nauthor was releasing these two books before a contract was signed, and they put up a listing\nfor both of them, and then left the one up for The Way of Kings even after we didn't\nput that in the contract, and fans found it, and then they became fans of my-- well, first\nthey became fans. They fanned this and were like, \"We're going\nto pretend we have this book.\" So they started taking fan pictures of themselves\nwith the book with a fake cover that had Elvis on it, and a quote from Terry Goodkind that\nsaid, \"A hunk o\u2019, hunk o\u2019 burning good book.\" They started to put fake quotes on the back\nof it. Amazon just let you upload your own photos\nand information. They were doing a Wikipedia thing back then. So there's all these wonderful quotes from\nmade-up people talking about loving the book, and there's a bunch of fake reviews of people\nloving the book and talking about the killer penguins and all this stuff. Regardless, TOR did eventually make that page\nvanish. I'm sorry. STUDENT: Do you have records of it? BRANDON: I do have records of it somewhere. I'm not sure where they are. I know fandom has some too. We have a copy of the book, I think, that\nthey printed off the fake cover and put on for us after it was published or something. But regardless, The Way of Kings was known\nin fandom, and they started to ask questions about it. They knew it was going to be my big epic. I always planned this to be the biggest and\nlongest of my series. It was the one that they knew the original\nfirst draft of was 300,000 words, which is way longer than my other books. The published version has 400,000 words. But they started saying to me, \"Brandon, how\nmany magic systems will this book have?\" I started to say, \"Thirty.\" Because I'm like, \"I'm going to develop 30\ndifferent magic systems. I'm going to have 10 magics based on each\nof the surges, and I'm going to have 10 magics based on void binding, and I'm going to have\na bunch of different magical mechanisms for the Fabrials science, and I'm going to explain\nthese as 10 different magic systems and all the stuff.\" And I started to get caught up in the hype\nof bigger is better. This, when I went to my world building, is\nwhat I realized had ruined the first incarnation of The Way of Kings, the thinking that bigger\nis better, because it's not. Now, there are some cases where bigger is\nbetter. It's not strictly true. It's not strictly untrue. If you love a book already, you get into it,\noftentimes you're like, \"Wow, I'm glad there's so much more of this book to love.\" And if the storyline you're trying to tell\nis improved by having a large arc in the same story like The Way of Kings, then big is better\nfor that book in that instance. But big is not strictly better. In fact, with world building, I think it is\nusually worse. So Sanderson's Third Law is where I realized\nthat \"Before adding something new to your magic, and I'll put your setting in\ngeneral, see if you can instead expand what you have.\" There is a game series called The Elder Scrolls,\nwhich I love. A lot of people leave reviews on some installments\nof this, because The Elder Scrolls has always been about using a vast setting as a way to\nengage you. In fact, the first one I played was called\nDaggerfall, and the reason it hooked me, people said, \"You've got to play this. There are, like, 10,000 different dungeons\nand they are all unique.\" They used procedurally generated dungeons\nto create Daggerfall. I played it, and then I realized that those\n10,000 dungeons were the same 10 assets recombined in enough ways to make 10,000 whatever. Not 10 assets, but, you know, a number of\nassets. In fact, people started reviewing the game,\nsaying, \"They are an ocean that is an inch deep.\" This was one of the big criticisms for the\nseries. In fact, one they kind of tried to fix in\nthe most recent one, Skyrim by saying, \"We're going to back away from the procedural generation,\nand make some of these dungeons have a lot of attention to detail, particularly the ones\nthat you're most likely to play through, so that they're interesting and engaging.\" And indeed, having 10 dungeons in a game that\nare really well made, turns out, for most player experiences, is way better than 10,000\ndungeons that are basically all boring. This is what you run into with our magic systems\nand your settings if you start to say, \"Wow, Sanderson is doing a 10-book epic with all\nof this stuff in it. In order to write an epic fantasy, therefore,\nI need to have my languages all built ahead of time. I need to have the lore going back 10,000\nyears. I need to have built all of these different\ninteresting religious systems and governments and magic systems. And, oh, no! I need 10 PhDs to write this book.\" The danger here is that that's not necessarily\nbetter. Now certainly, having an expertise and applying\nit to a book, or even making sure you're doing a wide variety of different things in your\nbook can be very handy. But most readers will latch onto one idea\ndone really well, better than they will latch onto 100 ideas just barely touched on. In Way of Kings, the original, instead of\ntaking and trying to do 10 different character lines 10% of the way done, if I instead picked\nthree, Dalinar, Kaladin, and Shallan, and I told a really good chunk of their stories,\nturns out the book is way better. Because doing a really good job with three\ncharacters and having a bunch of side characters who all have interesting hooks, and they'll\nall get their own books eventually, but in that first book making sure-- really, the\nfirst book is 50% or more Kaladin and doing his story just as best as I could do it, with\nDalinar and Shallan just being there enough to get you interested in them, because you\nknew they were going to have more extensive arcs later. That book worked. You should apply this in many cases to your\nworld building. If you're asking yourself, \"All these things\nI need to do,\" if you instead say, \"You know what? I'm really interested in religion. If I create three interesting religions that\nall come off of the same branch, like Christianity, Judaism, and Islam branched off of kind of\nthe same core theology long ago, it creates an interesting relationship between these\nthree religions. If they're all taking a different perspective\non it, and I dig into that perspective, and maybe I related that to a magic in the world,\"\nyou are going to have a better book than if you say, \"There are 50 different religions\nin this book. It's so diverse and interesting. You're going to love it.\" That book with three religions done well,\nalmost always going to be a better book. This is about learning to dig deeper into\na concept and explore the different ramifications of it, instead of just throwing everything\nyou can think of into a book. This is really important for fantasy and science\nfiction, because we are coming to fantasy and science fiction because of the world building. In general, we want to come to this world\nbuilding and be transported to a different place. It's very common for the author to say, I'm\ngoing to take you to a different place. I'm going to put all this weird stuff in,\nbut then not leaving the reader with something to latch onto, that is really interesting,\nthat presents itself an interesting problem or an interesting hook. That interesting problem or hook related to\nthe world building is way more vital than these other things. Next week we'll dig into all the different\ntypes of things you can put into a fantasy novel, and it will feel like, \"Oh, no, I need\n100 PhDs to write this book.\" The whole goal of that lecture, though, is\nto kind of push you, to expand what you view story or science fiction to be, and to try\nto find where your niche for a given book might be, latch onto it, and do it really\nwell. If you are writing a big epic fantasy, you\nprobably need to be multiples of these, and in fact, you need to learn a skill which we'll\ntalk about as the iceberg theory of world building. When I first became a writer, I heard a lot\nof authors on panels talking about how world building should be an iceberg, the classic\niceberg theory. Here's the iceberg, here's the water, and\nthere is this huge body of world building underneath the ice that the reader should\nbe able to tell that you did, but you're not going to show them on the page. Right? Well, this is usually wrong. This is not what writer doing most of the\ntime. Pulling the drapes back and showing you the\nwizard behind the screen, most of the time what we're actually doing is we're doing that. It is a hollow iceberg, that we've done just\nenough work so that if you look down through the water, you're like, \"Yup, it goes on.\" That would flip over, by the way, in real\nlife, so I understand that. STUDENT: How about an iceberg with a steel\nbottom? BRANDON: Yes, with a steel bottom. But what we're really doing is this. Because unless your grandpa told you, and\nyou can take 20 years and a degree in linguistics to create world building for 20 years, which,\nby the way, there's nothing wrong with, and if that's what you want to do, great. But remember, this class' job is to assume\nyou want a professional career in sci-fi/fantasy where you're releasing books consistently,\nbecause that's what you'll need to do in the market today, is have a book every few years. You don't have time to do that iceberg that\npeople are talking about. So what you do instead is, you learn to fake\nit. Writing books is like being a stage magician. If you want to surprise people with twist\nendings, it's all about making them pay attention to this hand while you're slowly giving them\nthe information they need so you can punch them in the face later. If you are doing world building, you are doing\nonly what you absolutely need for your story, and you are hinting that the rest is there\nin a way that lets the reader say, \"Oh, they've done all that. They have it all in their head. I can trust them, and I can just let myself\nenjoy this world.\" Oftentimes, that's by doing things like saying,\nmentioning there's this other thing that these people know about that the main characters\ndon't, and okay. Or it's done, we'll talk when we talk about\nprose, it's done by getting small details right so that the reader is allowed to just\nassume you got everything else right. Or it's about doing one thing really well\nthat the reader knows you've done well, so that they trust you that all the rest of it\nis there when you tell them, \"By the way, it's all totally there. We have 10,000 worlds of history built for\nthis, but you don't need to learn it, because it would bore you right now.\" And the reader's like, \"Yeah, it would. Thanks. I'm glad you did all that work.\" When really you did none of it. Next week we'll talk about how to do that. But let's end with Sanderson's Zeroeth Law. Sanderson's Zero Law is very quick. Sanderson's Zeroeth Law came when I was doing\nall of this, and I started to ask myself, \"How often is this where a story starts for\nme?\" The answer is, not very often. Now, the Sanderson's Three Laws generally\nhave a lot to do with my building of an outline, and they have a lot to do with how I do my\nrevisions and write my story. But Sanderson's Zeroeth Law is where stories\nbegin. Sanderson's Zeroeth Law is, \"Always err on\nthe side of what is awesome.\" This is because I wanted to be very clear\nwith myself that most of my ideas-- my idea for Way of Kings, where did it start? It didn't start with all this cool stuff. It started because I wanted to tell a story\nabout knights with magical power armor. That is the origin, well one of them, there's\na lot of different threads that became The Way of Kings, but one of the main origins\nwas, wow, power armor is cool. I want fantasy power armor. How can I make that work? Well, big, enormous, cool magic swords are\ncool, but they don't make any sense really narratively in most settings. How can I make a setting where giant magic\nswords would be the thing you'd actually want to have? That is where I start, is with the cool idea,\nand then I work backward. So I'll just leave that with you. Remember that making a great story is the\ngoal, and if these rules help you do that, great. I'm glad I shared them with you. If they don't, throw them away. We'll see you guys next week. CLASS: (applause)"}, "6": {"0": " BRANDON: All right, guys, World Building Week\nTwo. Woo hoo! The fun stuff. We'll be talking about world building this\nweek and then we will have Mary Robinett here to do next week, a lecture on short stories. And at some point I will do the Q&A on worldbuilding,\neither maybe next week is half of that lecture, depending on how much time Mary Robinett takes,\nor maybe the week after. I will get to the questions that you guys\nasked last week and we'll ask this week if they're things you're curious about. Before we kind of really dig into this lecture,\nI wanted to ask you guys to list a few of your favorite stories in regard to worldbuilding\nspecifically, film or book or video game. What are your favorites? Yeah. STUDENT: John Wick. BRANDON: Okay. John Wick. All right. What do we got here? STUDENT: Avatar the Last Airbender. CLASS: (cheering) BRANDON: I think you were priced into saying\nthat one, right? All right. Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: Firefly. BRANDON: Firefly, great. All right. Firefly. Yeah. Go ahead. STUDENT: The Expanse. BRANDON: You like The Expanse. All right let's get one more. Sure, we'll go over on this side, because\nI haven't-- STUDENT: Dune. BRANDON: Dune. All right, great. OK. That'll be relevant later. We're going to use those. But let me ask you guys a different question. You are presumably in this class specifically\ninstead of the other creative writing classes, which you might also be taking, but you're\nhere because of worldbuilding. That's what differentiates this class from\nthe others being offered. This is the sci-fi and fantasy themed creative\nwriting course at the university. So why? Why do you want to learn to build worlds? Why are you building worlds? What is it to you? What does it mean to you to have world building\nin a story?", "135": " STUDENT: It means the world to me. BRANDON: It means the world to you. OK. Great. Yeah. Go ahead. STUDENT: I need a world that can implement\ncool designs I have in my head that aren't physically possible. BRANDON: OK. All right. Let's write a few of these up. That's one that I noted. The impossible made plausible, is one of the\npurposes of world building, to take that impossibility and make it-- you're able to suspend disbelief\nwhile you're in there. STUDENT: Theme. BRANDON: What's that? Theme? So you can play with theme. All right. Like that. How does worldbuilding play with theme? STUDENT: Like if you're having, for example,\na more serious story, you could have more serious or grungy setting. You could do, like, sort of storypunk or something. BRANDON: OK. STUDENT: Versus something a lot more fantastical\nwould be like a fantasy. BRANDON: Awesome. What else? What else have you guys got? Why do you like worldbuilding\nin stories? Why do you read stories with lots of worldbuilding? STUDENT: Because my real life is boring. BRANDON: OK. Okay. So can we say maybe sense of wonder and/or\nexploration in regard to that? Or, you know, we could probably also wright\ndown here shear coolness to encapsulate those things. What else? Go ahead. STUDENT: I really enjoy seeing like a cultural\nbutterfly effect. You change one small thing. BRANDON: Right. OK. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll write that up. I love how you put that \"cultural butterfly\neffect.\" Butterfly. OK. Great. Yeah. STUDENT: The abilities to explore real world\nproblems in a world that's disconnected from ours. BRANDON: Yep. Yeah. How can we phrase this? What's that? STUDENT: Zootopia. BRANDON: Zootopia. I actually had-- what did I write down? Let me look at my list of notes. I wrote down something for this. STUDENT: Inception. BRANDON: Yeah. Ability to approach ideas in a fresh way. How about that? Approach. How do you spell approach? Real world. I'll just make-- that spells approach. I totally got it right. Ideas in a kind of disconnected way, right? Disconnected. We'll talk about this. Your ability-- you can talk about something\nwithout the baggage that it brings to talk about it in a real-world setting. And this allows you just kind of to approach\ndifficult ideas in directions that are maybe not as immediately-- STUDENT: Polarizing? BRANDON: Yeah. Polarizing. That's a good way to put it. Immediately polarizing. Anything else, you guys? Yeah. Go ahead. STUDENT: It's reminiscent of the sins. BRANDON: What's that? STUDENT: It's reminiscent of the sins. BRANDON: Reminiscent of the sins. OK. OK. Play God. Yeah, absolutely. Actually, one of my favorite comics on the\nwhole internet, look it up sometime, is Cave Man Science Fiction. And this comic is a bunch of cavemen science\nfiction scenarios. And at the end, the moral is, \"I am play gods,\"\nmeaning, \"Oh, I've made a mistake. I pretend to be the gods.\" Really funny. You guys should go read it.", "360": " All right, let's talk about this because sci-fi/fantasy\nhas this weird disconnect that I've noticed, at least in writing it, which is that the\nsetting is both the thing that defines us as sci-fi/fantasy writers or sci-fi/fantasy\nworks, and is at the same time the least important part of our stories. You may laugh about that, but in most cases\nI think it is true. Generally, if you have a story with excellent\nworldbuilding but bad characters and story, or bad characters or bad story, you're going\nto have a worse story than one that does an excellent job of character and story and has\nweak worldbuilding. And so of the three sort of things I talk\nabout that make up our stories, our setting, our plot, and our character, your time is\nbest spent learning how to make engaging and interesting characters, followed by learning\nhow to tell a really good plot, with, in third place, your ability to have a really great\nsetting. Now ideally you want to learn to do all three. However, I think there is a tendency to have\nwhat we sometimes call world builder's disease. Yes. This is where you become so enthralled with\nbuilding the world of your story that you never finish worldbuilding and never start\nyour story. And if you do start your story, you've spent\nso much time on your awesome world building that you want to fill every nook and cranny\nof your story with that world building, and by so doing, you undermine the story that\nyou're actually telling. And so because of this, one of the things\nI like to talk about when we get to world building, because, don't get me wrong, it\nis important. Having a great world will be a bonus to your\nstory. I'd like to talk about world building in service\nof story. Ways that we can use, as has been pointed\nout on the board, theme, that we can use the worldbuilding that we're doing to enhance\nthe specific story we want to tell so that that worldbuilding becomes a big part of that\nstory, and an important part of that story, and not just something that's there like billboards\nto watch on the way to actually getting to your story. That's what you want to avoid. Now, as a little aside on this, I want to\ntalk about info dumps, and about conveying information in a fantasy world or a science\nfiction world.", "530": " I often say that I consider the grand skill\nof writing science fiction fantasy, the single most important thing to learn for sci-fi/fantasy,\nas opposed to other genres, is learning to convey information about your world in a way\nthat is interesting and not boring. And this is a trick to master writing sci-fi/fantasy. That's not to say that this will make up for\nbad characters or a bad story, but if you are doing a good job with those, mastering\nthis, I think, is the single best thing you can do to get yourself picked up by agents,\nto get passed up to editors or to, you know, make it to that next round of acquisition,\nor if you're self-publishing, to make sure that people when they are reading that first\nchapter, say, \"I want to read the next one,\" and that is to make sure you are conveying\nyour world building without boring people. This can be kind of hard. So I've got a couple tricks to recommend to\nyou on doing this. And the first one is to always think of your\nworldbuilding in service of the story you're telling and in service of making good characters. And if you can find a way that you can convey\nyour setting information through the eyes of your characters in a way that exemplifies\nwho that character is, so that the point of the sentence or the paragraph is actually\nto give us more information about the character, but you, as a side effect, tell people about\nthe world, it's what you want to do. For a kind of example of this, a metaphor\nof this, my wife often has trouble getting my children to eat vegetables. This is really super uncommon. I know it's only my children who won't eat\ntheir vegetables. But she realized in the mornings they like\nto have a smoothie with breakfast, and they really like, because they're little boys,\nwe have three little boys, when things look gross. And so putting a handful of spinach into a\nsmoothie and turning it green, they loved. They're like, \"It is so gross. It looks like snot. Yum!\" This is just how my children are. \"Oh, it's radioactive goo! Yum!\" And you do that by throwing in a handful of\nspinach. Well, this is how you want to have your world\nbuilding gotten across to your readers. You want them to be getting the world building\nby saying, \"Wow, this story and these characters are so fascinating. Oh, and by the way, I know a whole bunch about\nHogwarts now.\" This is how you want to be conveying your\nworld building. And you want to avoid the, number one, the\nencyclopedia entry. A lot of fantasy in its early days, in particular\nfantasy, some science fiction, would start with an encyclopedia entry. Not very well-disguised either. Like you'd start up and it's like, here is\nthe myth of this world. And then there's basically a whole bunch of\nbroccoli or spinach thrown at you where you're like, you're going to have to track who all\nthese gods are, so we're going to give you kind of a boring write up of the history and\nlore of this world before we start the book. Or sometimes they were literal encyclopedia\nentries put in the front or the back of the book. Tolkien. I love Tolkien. Lots of encyclopedia entries. He invented a new subgenre. We can give him a pass. And he still did it better than almost anyone\ndoes it. But, a lot of encyclopedia entries. Like, \"I can't get this all in the story,\nso I'm going to give you, you know, an encyclopedia.\"", "748": " You want to avoid that. Now you can do this in a couple of ways. One is to start trying to get more of it into\ndialogue. You run into troubles when you're doing this,\nhowever, for some reason we call maid and butler dialog. Maid and butler dialog comes from the old\nstage plays where they would often start the stage play by having the maid and the butler\ncome up onto the stage and be like, \"As you know, the master is away for the weekend.\" And the other one's like, \"Yes. And as you know, the lady has been getting\nvery close with the coachman.\" And they're basically explaining to each other\nthings that they already know. Avoid maid and butler dialog. It reads really stilted and is kind of a problem. We'll talk about more if we're go into dialog\nlater in the year. But the idea, stilted dialog is often dialog\nthat feels like the character is not acting according to their own sincere motivations,\nbut according to the author's motivations in getting out certain information and making\nit the plot happen. So avoid maid and butler, moving things more\nto dialog, but also giving us less than you think we need is generally a good example. One of the things I learned in my grad program,\nand it wasn't from one of the teachers, but perhaps the most valuable lesson I learned\nwas from another student, who taught me about something called the pyramid of abstraction.", "835": " And he said, imagine your descriptions as\na pyramid. The goal of your descriptions are to form\nkind of the base of a pyramid, so that you ground a reader into a story, so that when\nyou start talking about things that are a little more high level, or a little more abstract,\nor if you're going to go inside the character's head for a little bit and do what we call\nnavel gazing, where the is ruminating on, \"Oh, man, I have all these problems, let me\nlist them off one at a time so that you, the reader, are aware that I'm aware that I have\nall these problems.\" Whenever you're doing things like this, that\nsort of stuff is pulling the reader out of the story, because it's diverting the reader\nfrom the setting, and they become more and more aware of the author doing things. If you want to have a character ruminate on\nthe nature of art in a story, then the more you do that, the more, ironically, it will\npull the reader out and make them start thinking, this is the author giving me a lesson or a\nlecture, instead of the character actually dealing with this. And my friend said, and I really believe is\ntrue, the way that you offset that, because you want to have some of this stuff in stories,\nis you let the abstract, be the tip on the", "915": " pyramid that you earn by laying your groundwork\nwith concrete language, so that the reader is very firmly set in your world in a real\nconcrete place and time, that then when that character's walking along and starts having\na discussion about the nature of art with someone next to them, you are still imagining\nthem walking down the street in this place that you have painted very well, so that you\ndon't have this problem of losing them off in the ether. And this works very well for worldbuilding\nas well. By being able to-- you have this character\nsay, \"Well, magic works like this.\" You're already kind of going into this abstract. It's stuff the reader needs. It's that broccoli, that spinach. But you want to have grounded them first in\nthe setting. And my friend did a really cool thing with\nme that helped me kind of understand what he meant by abstract versus concrete. And some of you have watched these lectures\nbefore, have talked about this before will understand, that-- let's just say you've got\nat the bottom concrete and the top abstract.", "984": " Where would you put, if you're going to talk\nabout love, if you're going to say someone's experiences with love, where is that on the\nabstract-concrete scale. What's that? Yeah. More on the abstract side. Right? Love. Now you can pull that down by making sure\nyou're talking about what love means to this person and the actual emotions. Where would you put it if you say the character\nsaw a dog? Where is that? Dog is way up here, probably right underneath\nlove, but maybe above it. Because everyone in this room, when you say\ndog, how many of you imagine the same dog? Almost none of you. How many of you imagined love, and are on\nthe same page? Hey, my friend's argument, I put it right\nunderneath. His argument dog is above love in abstractness. More of us, if you just say love, are going\nto have experienced a similar thing to one another, than if you just say a dog, because\nthe picture that pops into your head is going to be completely abstract from-- it's going\nto be completely different from everyone else. Now if you say it was a mangy little white\ndog with one leg that was whimpering on the side of the street in a puddle, flaked with\nmud from the passing carriage, then you're all imagining a very similar dog.", "1083": " And so that pulls dog down into the concrete. Now, there's a lesson to be learned here,\nhowever. Down is not always better. We talk about in writing this phrase called\nshow don't tell. And it's become a mantra. It's this thing, it's like, anytime anything's\nwrong in a story, people will be like, \"Well, you didn't show enough. You told too much.\" And they're often right. But show versus tell is not something to hold\nup as, like, the absolute gold standard, because", "1115": " almost always showing more and pulling down\non the pyramid of abstraction requires what? More words. And so the more words you spend, the more\nconcrete you can generally make things. Now, if you understand this model well, what\nyou're going to do is you're going to learn how to use those more words to pull yourself\ndown rather than just using words that are meaningless. And you will find if you actually look at\nyour writing, you will be using a lot of meaningless words. You'll be doing a couple of things. I do this a lot in my first drafts. You will be doing what we call a tell then\nshow. This is where your paragraph starts with a\nline kind of explaining, \"He was a really nervous person.\" And then your next line is, \"He sat at the\ntable tapping his pen against it and moving his foot like this.\" That is what we call tell then show. The show is enough. You don't need to have a thesis sentence in\nyour paragraph telling us what you're going to then show us. But we do it a lot because as writers we're\ntrying to organize our thoughts, and then we go on to the show. You will find these all the time still in\npublished books where the author didn't catch that one and delete it out. You want to learn to delete those out? I have a word that comes up that is very controversial\nin this, is the word suddenly or abruptly. A lot of writers will say, just don't use\nthat, just make it abrupt or sudden, the thing that's happening. I still tend to prefer using the suddenly,\nbecause it becomes a marker very well to the reader. But this is why we say get rid of the passive\nvoice. Get rid of too many adverbs. Get rid of too many descriptors that don't\nactually pull you down on the pyramid of abstraction. And you'll find you're doing this a lot. You're using a lot of verys. You know, \"He was very mad,\" instead of saying,\n\"He was irate.\" Irate is further down than very mad, but very\nmad uses more words. Any time you can go down by using fewer words,\nyou're almost always wanting to make that change. And you want to get rid of these sentences\nthat'll often just not say anything or will have lots of just modifier words that don't\nmean anything. \"A little bit,\" and things like that. \"Little bit\" is one I use all the time, whereas\nI'm going through my revisions, I don't need to say that he stumbled a little bit. A stumble is a little fall. It's already in the word. I don't need the \"a little bit,\" but I use\nit all the time. You will find all sorts of things like this\nthat you can cut that will cost you nothing", "1275": " on moving up or down the pyramid of abstraction,\nor things you can cut and replace that will move you down. Learn to do these things to start really grounding\nyour reader in a world that feels very real. Dan Wells, good friend of mine, has advice\nthat if you want the reader to believe you about the big things, that there's this big\nproblem in the political system, you often describe one small thing very concretely that\nimpacts the characters in a way that will make you really understand this. Saying that, they the cantina is a hive of\nscum and villainy is nowhere near as useful as having two random people decide to bully\nLuke and almost get him killed until a hand has to get cut off. So grounding people in these scenes, showing\nthem the ideas you want, pulling down on the", "1330": " pyramid of abstraction, good to start grounding\nyour world building. And you will find if you start to do this,\nthen you will have more space in your story to kind of talk about, now and then, slipping\nin worldbuilding details. This is why it is almost always better to\nstart with your character in a situation where they want something, even if not relate to\nthe main plot. They can't have it, and we get to see them\nworking proactively to get the thing they want. And we explain only as much world building\nas you need for that single instance for that character, to grab us and ground us in a scene\nin a world, before you start to pile on more world building. These things work differently for different\nstories. I intentionally in Mistborn, if you haven't\nread this book, it starts off kind of working to ground you in the world. But the first time that the main character\nuses the magic I cut, and you don't see that scene. This is Kelsior attacking the manor house\nin the early chapters. Do not show it because there's a whole ton\nof world building. I'd have to drop on you to explain the magic. And it works so much better if I hold that\noff until you are more grounded in the actual setting and characters and then you get it. Way of Kings, I throw it all at you in the\nprologue, the second prologue. The one I actually called prologue of the\nthree, I throw it all right at you. Why did I do this? Well, understanding I had already an established\naudience who already was looking forward to reading about an interesting magic system,\nknowing I only had to explain one of the many types of magic I was putting into the story,\nand knowing that this story needed to start off with something dynamic that promised where\none of the character arcs was going to go later on, I made the decision in that case\ninstead to lead with a character using the magic. But that increases my learning curve, and\nthat increases the likelihood that someone is going to put the book down and get bored\nearly on. And if you go read reviews of Way of Kings,\npeople who give it low stars often put it down early because the learning curve was\nso steep, and I wasn't therefore able to hook them into the characters as quickly because\nI was spending so much more time on lore and world. That was a risk I was willing to take for\nthat specific story, but it also has a cost to it. Learn to make things more concrete. Learn to deliver your world building through\nthe eyes of the characters. Robert Jordan was a genius at this. When a character walks in the room and says\nthere's a cup of water sitting on the table, the way they describe that cup of water will\ntell you a ton about their culture and their history and who they are. When you can describe a cup of water in a\nway that gives you more worldbuilding about a person's culture than most people's three\nparagraph-long encyclopedia entries, then you are mastering the grand skill of writing\nscience fiction and fantasy.", "1516": " All right? Questions about these ideas? Yes. STUDENT: So in Warbreaker where you did something\nsimilar, to the fact where you show magic right away in that. BRANDON: Yep. STUDENT: So would you say a takeaway for that\nis if the excitement matches the level of the explanation you can pull it off? BRANDON: Oh, yeah. It's much easier. Like if you were able to explain-- oftentimes\nin a fantasy book, it is good to lead with the magic, I would say, if you can do it through\nthe eyes of a character who is achieving a goal and what they are doing is intrinsic\nto the magic, some of the best ways to start fantasy books is indeed in that way. And so \"Here is a problem in the magic or\nsome obstacle I need to overcome. Here's me using the magic in a simple, easy-to-understand\nway that evokes an entire world,\" that's more-- like, you can use that small instance of a\ndescription of one part of the magic to indicate there's a much larger world to explore. But let's make sure you master this one thing\nfirst. That can be a really great way to start a\nfantasy story. But again, try to keep it grounded in the\ncharacter's motivations. And a lot of times what's working is character\nmotivation. Here's a line of worldbuilding. Character motivation, concrete description. Here's a line of worldbuilding. And you're moving this through. This is why so often you see authors using\nWatson characters in fantasy novels, apprentice characters. A person who's unfamiliar with the world or\nsetting getting it explained to them as they're trying to navigate some sort of issue or problem\nin the world, lets you get it out slowly. But it also lets you have this what we call\nhang a lantern on it, where the person can be like, \"I don't understand this.\" And the other person saying, \"There's no time\nto explain. This is the one thing you need to know right\nnow.\" And then that works really well. But there's a reason why the apprentice plot\nbecame the go-to plot in the '80s for fantasy novels. Almost all of them were apprentice plots,\nall the big ones, where someone young is learning about a fantastical world and then gets introduced\nto it step by step by some old master, so that you, as the reader, can follow that path. That gets really repetitive if it's done too\nmuch, which is why in the '90s you saw an explosion of things that didn't do this, like\nGame of Thrones or whatnot, where it was like, no, we're just going to throw you right in. Boom. Deal with it. Here we go. But then Harry Potter came and portal fantasy\nis-- Harry Potter is a hard one to use as an example, because portal fantasies are always\ngoing to be very popular in middle grade. They started basically with Alice in Wonderland\nand they go all the way through Narnia all the way up to Harry Potter. And this is because it gives you an easy way\nto make the Watson character, the protagonist, who also gets to go with you and explore this\nfantasy world. And generally, by genre, as you're your age\ngroup gets older, the more you can count on a steeper learning curve. Middle grade needs the shallowest learning\ncurve in general, YA can get a little steep, and adult, it can be like this. It can be Stephen Ericksen, right? Just like, oh, here's a wall. Climb up it by your fingernails and then you'll\nlove this. That is very hard sell in middle grade. I don't know that I've read a book that has\nhad anywhere near that steep learning curve, even something like Sabriel by Garth Nix,\nwhich is more YA than middle grade anyway, starts you and then transition's you in, even\nthough the character is part of the world. It's very common to do something like this. Middle grade and YA have different sort of\nunderstandings there. But even in adult, sometimes you want to come\nup with a really shallow learning curve for various purposes. Yeah. STUDENT: What's your advice with including\nworld building or magic systems with journal entries without it being too [___]? BRANDON: Right. World building or magic systems in journal\nentries. I do it a lot. I use them as epigraphs at the start of stories,\nbecause that forces me to dole it out slowly and only used it kind of as flourishes here\nand there. I tend to like it. I think it works pretty well. But you have to understand there's a percentage\nof your readership who will not read them. Because of that, anything you're putting in\nthere, you need to be careful to try and reinforce the story or make not vital to the A plot\nline of what your story is. You can't always do this, but I often recommend\nimagining that people are not going to read them or remember them because of the way they\nare. The majority of your audience will. But you can't count on it as much as if it's\nin the text. And this kind of gets into this other idea\nof worldbuilding in service of story, like", "1814": " whether you want to use epigraphs, or you\nwant to use songs like Grandpa Tolkien did, or whether you want to have a steep learning\ncurve or a shallow learning curve, really comes into the question of, what are you trying\nto do with your story and how does your setting enhance it? Let's go to our list over here.", "1836": " Let me ask you this. For those who love the assassins sort of thing\nof the John Wick universe, how does the setting of the John Wick universe enhance the story\nthat they're trying to tell? STUDENT: It sets the rules of the universe\nthat the characters all have to abide by and establishes the consequences of breaking them. BRANDON: Right. This is a very violent, dangerous world, where\nif you transgress a simple rule, it can lead to massive consequences. And the world building is there to warn you\nthat all of these rules, they're very touchy. They're very touchy. Anyone else want to talk about John Wick? Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: This is like an entire world of assassins,\nand John Wick's supposed to be the awesomest guy. BRANDON: Yeah. STUDENT: With the entire society of assassins,\nit makes him even cooler to be the top of this world. BRANDON: It's an entire world of assassins. I'm going to repeat it for the microphone\nhere. And if John Wick is the best of them all,\nby showing how cool everyone else is, you then establish how cool he is, just through\nnatural sort of consequences of the world building. Star Trek did this sort of thing with Worf\nall the time. There's actually a TV Tropes page on it, where\nif they wanted to establish how awesome a bad guy was, they had them beat up Worf, because\nyou know how cool Worf was. And if Worf gets beat up, then this person\nmust be cool. They did it enough that Worf, if you actually\nlook at what happens in the things, is actually not that tough, because people are beating\nhim up all the time. But this is the same sort of idea by establishing\nthis world. I really like this idea. It happens a lot in in espionage stories,\nthat your kind of like-- My wife and I say, all right, we're in spy world now. In spy world you can accept that everybody\nhas a minimum level of spy training. And every character you meet, like they're\njust certain tropes that if you're watching Alias, or if you're watching even a James\nBond movie, that you just be like, you know what, this is spy world. There's going to be tons of double crosses\nbecause no one trusts each other because they live in spy world and they've just all been\nbetrayed 100 times. And using the setting to enhance that idea,\nso that you're on board for the fact that the main character is going to be not willing\nto trust. You're using your world building to enhance\nyour story. Let's ask about Last Airbender, a popular\nchoice.", "1981": " We'll go to you first and then we'll ask others. How does Last Airbender, how does Avatar,\nuse its worldbuilding specifically in service of the story they want to tell? STUDENT: They set up a lot in the prologue\nand have Katara go through that. But it's not an infodump as much, because\nit personally relates to her and Sokka, I feel like. BRANDON: Right. STUDENT: And then the next instant is Sokka\nand Katara hunting, and that's how they introduce bending, this mutual goal that they-- BRANDON: They introduce water bending by having\nthem on a hunt. They've got a situation they're trying to\naccomplish, and the water bending helps them accomplish that. How else does the overall worldbuilding of\nAvatar enhancing its story? STUDENT: Well, the entire A plot of the story\nis part of the world. BRANDON: STUDENT: I mean, the bending, Aang as the\nAvatar. BRANDON: Right. STUDENT: It's [___] character arc and the\nwhole thing with Sozin's Comet. That was the big event that the story is leading\nup to that is just inherently part of the world. BRANDON: Yeah. And I would say that you mentioned Aang with\nall these things. I would mention that one of the best things\nthey do is they establish factions that are at war and then they give you a person whose\njob is kind of to unite the elements. Hey, theme! This is about uniting the factions and making\npeace by having one person who represents the unification of all of these things. And so, therefore, worldbuilding becomes theme\nin that way. Go ahead. STUDENT: It gives an excuse for why the fate\nof the universe is in a 12-year-old's hands. BRANDON: Yes. Excuse for why the fate of the universe is\nin a 12-year-old's hands, and a very silly 12-year-old as well. Go ahead. STUDENT: They show us all of these amazing\npowers, like the phenomenal, literal earth-bending abilities of this magic system, and then they\nput it on that 12-year-old kid to save the world, and a huge part of his character and\nthe plot is him learning to deal with the fact that he, like, all these phenomenal powers\nthat he has to learn and overcome. It becomes the world building, but it adds\nso much to his personal character arc and the burdens he has. BRANDON: Right. I would say you nailed it right there. The fact that there are all these four factions\nand all of them are so powerful, and then putting all of these wishes, these desires,\nthis responsibility on Aang, it's a story about him accepting his responsibility. And the world building enhances that by showing\nhow tough it is to master all the different magics, which is a metaphor for him learning\nto master all of the responsibilities that have been placed on him. Excellent. Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: It makes it easy to break it down\ninto three seasons. BRANDON: Makes it easy to break it down in\nseasons. There is a reason why Mistborn has three magic\nsystems, as I told you in the previous week, and we dig into one in each book. Very nice structure. Go ahead. STUDENT: It's based on real world religion\nand philosophies that are familiar enough that it doesn't need too much explanation. BRANDON: Yeah, it's familiar. What he said is that it's based on real world\nphilosophies and religions, which allows us to not have to explain as much by using the\nfour Aristotelian elements and kind of using like-- before Avatar came out, I remember\ntalking to some people and being like, \"I'm so tired of water, earth, fire, air as your\nmagic system.\" And yet in this story, they did it fantastically\nwell and kind of proved that anything that has become a clich\u00e9, done well, stops being\na clich\u00e9 real fast and starts being an advantage instead of like-- what do they say in programing? It's a feature, not a bug. The fact that these bendings are established,\nthat you can kind of kind of imagine what would a fire bender do, that you can make\nthat leap by yourself, and then they can show this person and then expand on it in their\nworld, can be very handy. Now, the danger with some of these things\nis, some things that have become used so often, such as the vampire, what is a vampire, that\nyou also pull a lot of baggage. The Aristotelian elements, not as much. But you do have to watch for this. You're like, if I'm going to use a vampire\nto cut corners, but then my vampires are very different from vampires in other stories,\nyou're losing some of that worldbuilding learning curve stuff that you've got, and you're going\nto end up replacing it with info dumps that you're going to have to constantly remind\nthe reader that my vampires aren't like these other vampires, which in some ways is as much\nor more work than it is to just come up with your own thing. So that's a push and pull you have to kind\nof come up with on your own. STUDENT: Avatar has one of the best maps to\nplot stories. BRANDON: Yes. STUDENT: Because they're constantly moving\neverywhere, and every place they move to has a big impact on the story. BRANDON: Right. Using the map, the actual, like we talked\nabout, in the travelogue, that having a map with places you can go opens up a lot of mystery,\nbut also opens up you can follow the characters along. And Avatar, of course, has the map split up\nby kind of factions, which really enhances the sort of we're having an argument together. All right. And there's a lot of conflict going on. How about that?", "2296": " We have to move on. Otherwise, we'll spend all our time on this. Firefly. Anyone want to talk about how the worldbuilding\nof Firefly enhances the storytelling of Firefly? OK. Go ahead. STUDENT: It's really easy to feel the desperation\nand the difficulty that the characters are in when you understand how just kind of uncaring\nthe universe around them is, on one hand, and then on the other hand. If they get noticed by the Federation or whatever\nthe government group is called, they're just going to squash like a bug. They don't really care at all. BRANDON: Right. Establishing an uncaring universe where you\ncan get squashed like a bug, and also this kind of oppressive group. And then I would add to it, using the sort\nof Wild West metaphor to reinforce that they are in a place where they can get away with\nsome things. They're outside the law, allows them to have\nsome flexibility within the system. STUDENT: We learn a lot about Malcolm and\nZoe's characters by the fact that they were in a rebellion that lost. BRANDON: Right. STUDENT: So you automatically learn a lot\nabout the history of their characters, as well as learning about how the Federation\nis now. BRANDON: Putting them in a rebellion that\nlost is an excellent way to talk about there being this evil empire. To talk about their characterization is that\nI fought, I lost, I've stopped caring. No, I really haven't. But I pretend I have. Like, that gives excellent worldbuilding that\nrelates the story. Absolutely. Go ahead. STUDENT: I think the introduction of the Reavers\nwas extremely well done, because it wasn't-- I mean, it was, like, they were meeting the\nreaders. And then she says something super scary, which\ntells you just how bad it is. And you're also in a super tense situation,\nwhich sets up for pretty much everything else that comes later. BRANDON: Yeah. Introduction of the Reavers. It's called Reavers, right? Reavers, she says, was done very well. And, yeah, I agree. And in fact, part of this whole uncaring universe\nenhances the danger. Like in a lot of science fiction, something\nlike the Reavers, which are just like space pirates who've gone crazy, would not be that\ndangerous. But in this universe, they're super dangerous,\nbecause it's an uncaring universe and it's not full of force users and things like that. Yeah. STUDENT: I think a big thing is over the course\nof the series, you become so familiar with Serenity that it almost becomes a character\nunto itself. BRANDON: Right. STUDENT: It becomes a place that you want\nto be. I think that's something that a lot of visual\ntypes of media have in common. BRANDON: Yeah. STUDENT: Like with Avatar, the aesthetic pulls\nyou in. BRANDON: The aesthetic pulls you in. Serenity, the ship becomes a character. I would say that that's a good rule of thumb,\nregardless of what you're doing, that you want your setting to become a character unto\nitself, and treat it much as the way you would treat a character, and apply some of the lessons\nthat we're going to talk about in the character weeks to your setting, making it have interesting\nquirks. It maybe won't have motivations, but it can\nbe consistent in what it presents to the characters. All right. Let's quickly just do one on The Expanse and\none on Dune. The Expanse. Who wants to handle The Expanse? We'll go over here. STUDENT: The nice thing about The Expanse\nis that it makes everything really dangerous immediately. You're in space all the time. You're always dealing with really physical\nproblems and it forces the captain and his crew to make the captain and his crew to make\ndifficult decisions all the time. BRANDON: Forces the captain and the crew to\nmake difficult decisions all time, and it's another kind of uncaring universe, dangerous. And I would say some the world building in\nThe Expanse, like, a lot of the tension in The Expanse is either political tensions,\nor it is something is broken, and we need to fix it, is kind of how things go. And so they do a very good job of showing,\nyou need to understand the physics of this world if you're going to fly around space\nbecause you need to fix things that are broken. And if you don't, you're going to get squished. Dune. We cannot cover Dune by one person, but let's\nsee if somebody wants to handle Dune. By the way, Dune is my favorite worldbuilding\nsci-fi/fantasy world, probably of all time. So go ahead. Why does Dune's worldbuilding enhance its\nstory? STUDENT: Well, you're dropped in a setting\nwhere computers are immediately illegalized right at the start of the book, so you understand\nwhy there's not such a high technological place there. But at the same time, you're brought in to\nunderstand why there's this space war going on with the trading of spice. It just gives that sense of tension throughout\nthe entire story, is when you're dealing with it. BRANDON: Yeah. Gives tension to the story and things like\nthis. I would say one of the elements that makes\nit work is the spice. By having your fantastical resource be what\nthe universe needs to function, but also be central to the mythology and lore of the people\nliving on this planet, and immediately important to the political control of the main character\nwho's been put in charge of it, it becomes the lynchpin piece that makes it all work. And that making a fantastical resource work\nthat way really enhances the fact that this is going to be about factions fighting over\nit and the religion and how it intersects with some people wanting it for money, some\npeople wanting it for trade, other people wanting for religious purposes, all just enhances\nthis idea. We could talk about Dune for an entire three-hour\nsession, I'm willing to bet.", "2636": " But let's go ahead and move on to this idea\nof how you actually do this. This is all great. A lot of what we've been talking about here\nis kind of the abstract stuff. So how do you, Brandon Sanderson, sit down\nand build a system where this all works, where you're worldbuilding is done in service of\nyour story. How do you begin? And I usually divide my worldbuilding into\ntwo general categories. I have what I call the physical setting and\nthe cultural setting. This just helps me have a division point in\nmy mind of the different types of things that I'm going to try to world build. Now, physical setting, for me, is all the\nstuff that would exist whether or not there were sentient beings on the planet doing things. If you remove them all from the planet, this\nstuff would all exist. So this is things like the weather patterns. Or, the tectonic activity. Why don't you start throwing some more at\nme and we'll put them up on here? What else can you do for physical worldbuilding? STUDENT: The map. BRANDON: OK. The map. Yeah. What else? STUDENT: Wildlife. BRANDON: Flora and fauna. OK. What else? STUDENT: Some magic. BRANDON: Magic. I think you could say that the law of the\nmagic would exist without-- this is the physics, the cosmology of the universe. What else we got? STUDENT: The color of the sky. BRANDON: Yeah, yeah. The visuals. Yeah. STUDENT: The cosmology. BRANDON: What's that? The cosmology. Right. Yep. STUDENT: Climate and terrain. BRANDON: Climate and terrain. Terrain and climate. Are you guys going to make me spell climate? STUDENT: C-l-i-m-a-t-e. BRANDON: L-i-m-a-t-e. Yeah. STUDENT: What kind of people the people are. BRANDON: Yeah. Races. We'll go ahead and stop there. We could go on for a little bit longer. But this one starts to get-- you run through\nthem pretty quickly, what these things would be. Let's go over to cultural setting. Let's start talking about all the different\nthings you can world build with cultural setting. Start throwing them at me. STUDENTS: (shouting out answers) BRANDON: Religion. Government. Economics. Economics. Gender roles. Borders. Fashion. Food lore. History. History, which is too big. But there's lots of things underneath it. Rites of passage. That's actually r-i-t-e-s of passage. Hierarchy. Oh, that's another one that's hard to spell. Social ladders. That's one of the words that my computer has\nautomatically, because I type it wrong every time, to just change for me in autocorrect. You know what else I can't spell? I can't spell villain. I always put the I in the wrong place. What else you say? Accents. Yeah. Languages. Taboos/mores. Military. Yeah. Military tradition. Greetings. Swear words. Yeah. Oh, boy. We could go on for a long time, couldn't we? One lesson of this is there's a ton of things\nthat human beings do that are really interesting and really fascinating, and you could probably\nspend the rest of your life building a world where you took everything that we wrote on\nthe board, let's say we took an hour, wrote everything we think of on the board, and then\nyou could spend 80 years building a world where you consider every one of these things. Remember what we talked about last week with\nthe iceberg? Yeah. If you realistically want to have a career\nin sci-fi/fantasy, you are going to need to be able to produce, I would say, a book every\ntwo years at minimum. Now it depends on your subgenre and depends\non how popular your first book is. If your first book's pretty popular, that\nmoves to once every 10 years. No names mentioned. If you want to have a career in this, you\nneed to assume that you're going to, once you go full time on it, want to be able to\nproduce a book a year. All right? If you are producing a novel every year, they\ncan all be in the same series, if it takes off, though, as a little aside, if you're\ntrying to break in, you have a decision point to make, which is how much you write in the\nsame series and how much do you not. When I was breaking in, I realized if I sent\noff a book and someone rejected it that I couldn't send them book two. And so if I wrote 10 books and they were all\nin the same series, and then the first book got rejected by all six major publishers back\nthen, there's only five now, but got rejected by all six back in the days before self-publishing\nwas really viable, then those 10 books could not be sold, until maybe later if I broke\nin. So that is why, of the novels I wrote before\nI broke in, there were 13 of them, only one of them was a sequel, and it was a sequel\nto my first book where, this will happen with your first book sometimes, you just get halfway\ndone with what you wanted to do and you realize it's too long and you're like, all right,\nthis is the end. And then you just write the other half. That happens a lot when you're a newer writer\nbecause you don't know how to estimate how long a story will take you. But basically I wrote 12, 11 if you count\nsome of the things I did separate different things when I was trying to break in. That served me very well because I was able\nto always have a bunch of things on submission.", "3040": " Now there's somebody who did the very, very\ndifferent way for me, and that's Naomi Novick, who broke out around the same time I did. She had already written several books in her\nTemeraire, His Majesty's Dragon series. And it turns out that the first one was really\ngood, and it got picked up and then she was able to say them, \"Yeah, I've got two or three.\" I can never remember how many more she had\ndone, but she's like, \"I got two more done.\" And they're like, \"Wow.\" And this is the first instance of me seeing\nwhat eventually became a very strong strategy for self-publishing. And that was they published one a month for\nthree months. It was May, June, July, I think something\nlike that. First one came out. Boom. Second one came out; third one came out. Stephen King quote on the first, Anne McCaffrey\nquote on the second, Terry Brooks quote on the third, I think. And they did them straight to paperback, which\nearns a lot less money, but generally is easier to get someone to try out a new author. And they flooded the bookstores with these,\nand everyone was reading them, and they were fantastic. And it just basically gave a huge jumpstart\nto her entire career. And then the next one started coming out in\nhardcover. And all of a sudden it was, like, overnight\nNaomi was one of the best-selling authors in the genre, selling what other people had\ntaken 10 years to build up to because of how well they had done that sort of marketing\nblitz at the beginning. That's what she gained by writing everything\nin the same series. This is very common, by the way, and self-publishing\nthese days, in indie publishing, where you write a bunch of books in a series. Usually for indie publishing, you want them\nto be short, you want them to be episodic, and you want them to be fast paced. So you're looking at something either romance\nfocused, something action adventure focused, something mystery focused, where each one\nis its own story and then you get all those ready. You've written like 12, and then you're like,\n\"I'm releasing one every two weeks or every week for this huge blitz, and I'm going to\npay for all of my marketing money, and all of my book bubbing, and all of my Amazon ads\nduring this three-month blitz where I'm releasing all these things to try to jump start a series. I have never done this. So you would have to ask some indie authors\nwho have how it's worked for them, but I have seen it be very successful with various people. Regardless, you're going to have this decision\npoint of, do you write all in the same world", "3180": " or not? There is a halfway point, and this is where\nthey're all in the same world, but different characters. They're like the fake sequels to each other,\nkind of like Anne McCaffrey did. You see this a lot in romance where it's like,\nhere is a cast of characters, and here's the first one's romance, and the next one you're\ngoing to get this character's romance, and then this character's romance. And you could theoretically rejigger it so\nyou could sell any of those first if you needed to, depending on how you write it. Regardless, that was a little aside. If you're going to want to do this, you're\ngoing to have to be good at worldbuilding effectively, which generally is a synonym\nfor quickly, but not necessarily. This means you're not going to do all of this\nfor every book. In fact, you're going to highlight a few of\nthese things in a given story. Generally, I pick one from this side. A very big surprise for anyone who's read\nmy books. From this side, hey, we're going to have a\nreally strange weather pattern in this world, and we're going to then let that very strange\nweather pattern let us spiral into a few of these other things. But they're all coming off of the interesting\nweather pattern. And then I will pick a couple of these and\nI will really focus on them. Elantris, I focused a lot more on the linguistics. Why? Because the linguistics was the same as the\nmagic, and so I spent more time understanding what different languages people would speak. In Mistborn, no time on linguistics, almost\nnone at all. All of the linguistics in Mistborn were like,\nthey speak galactic standard. They all speak the same language. There's been an emperor in charge for a thousand\nyears. I'm not going to worry about the history. I'm not going to worry about the linguistics,\nbecause we're focused on the now. And I'm going to spend my time on the political\nsituation right now and also have a more complex magic system with all of those sort of-- imagine\nyou like have worldbuilding points. Like if you guys play, like, Warhammer or\nwhatever, and they're like, you have 100 points to build your army, you have 100 points to\nbuild your setting. And after you get above that threshold, you\nstart to lose your audience because you're stuffing too much in there. And the number of points you get is depending\non your subgenre that you're writing. Epic fantasy, more points. Urban fantasy, far fewer points. So you want to then target those points on\nthe things that are going to enhance your story in a way that's going to be interesting,\nexciting for the reader, but not feel like you're leaving stuff out, just feel like you're\nfocusing really well. This is kind of Sanderson's Third Law talked\nabout in this way. Let's just do a little experiment here. Let's write up, I'm going to write up four\ngeneral genres of story. You have an action adventure. You have a mystery. You have a romance. And give me one more. STUDENT: Horror. BRANDON: Horror. You've got a horror. All right so let's pick one of these on this\nside, and let's come up with a different take on it for each of these four things to build\na setting that would enhance our story. Raise your hand, somebody. We'll have you pick one of these things we've\nwritten up here. Go ahead. Anyone want to pick one? Go ahead. STUDENT: Climate. Super cold everywhere. BRANDON: OK, climate. The climate's going be different for each\none. We're just going to deal with the climate. So let's say you wanted to build a climate\nthat was going to work really interestingly to enhance your action adventure story. How would you do that? STUDENT: Everything's on fire. BRANDON: Everything's on fire. I like that. CLASS: (laughing) BRANDON: I don't know if that's actually a\nclimate. I don't know if Australia this summer is a\nclimate but give me another one. Let me ask you this. How would that enhance an action-adventure? Shyanne, was it you, the one that said that? Yeah. How does having everything on fire enhance\nan action adventure? STUDENT: It's volcanic. They're learning to live on a volcanic planet. BRANDON: They're learning to live. How does that enhance an action adventure\nstory? STUDENT: They have to avoid not falling in\nthe lava. BRANDON: OK, so you're going to have an action\nadventure story, which often will have moving from place to place and exploring exciting\nlocations. You have a dangerous, it\u2019s not really a\nclimate, but we'll go ahead. We've got a dangerous biome that is really\ndangerous to explore. But the characters are going to have to do\nit anyway. That enhances an action adventure. What else do we got on action adventure? Someone else suggest one. Go ahead. STUDENT: Super mild climate and then all of\na sudden turns hard and everything breaks down. BRANDON: Yeah. Out of nowhere, the climate goes crazy. In fact, I think there are action adventure\nmovies based around the idea of suddenly climate change hits us tomorrow. And now we have an action adventure story. You can see that they've done that, though. Sudden change in status quo is fantastic for\nan action adventure story. This is basically how you kick off an action\nadventure story, is a sudden change in status quo. Whether that change in status quo is climate\nchange happen tomorrow, for some reason, or it's, your father was investigating the lost\nark of the Covenant and he's missing. Sudden change in status quo kicks off an action\nadventure is a great way to start. Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: Regular fog banks reducing visibility\nto three feet. BRANDON: Regular fog bags reducing visibility\nthree feet. How does this enhance an action adventure\nstory? STUDENT: Enemies are all around you and you\nhave no idea. BRANDON: Enemies are all around and you have\nno idea. Great. All right let's move on to a mystery. Let's use-- shall we use climate, or do you\nguys want to move to a different one? Different one. All right. Pick something. STUDENTS: (answering indistinctly) BRANDON: Oh, wait. We'll do these ones in-- oh, fashion. We'll go ahead and do one of these. Why not? Someone said fashion. So we're going to talk about how fashion can\nenhance a mystery story. How could you use some worldbuilding with\nyour fashion in a way that will make your mystery more interesting? STUDENT: Many pockets. BRANDON: Many pockets. All right. Hey, someone said masks over here. A society that wears masks is going to be\ngreat for mystery because it will enhance the theme of your story, which is who is it? Who done it? They all wear masks. Go ahead. STUDENT: People change every single 20 minutes\nof the day. BRANDON: They change every 20 minutes? Maybe a little extreme, but maybe everybody\nchanges for each meal. How would that enhance a mystery? STUDENT: Well, say you have a detective. He has no idea. He knows what someone looks like, but they're\nconstantly changing. BRANDON: Oh, you mean change their features\nas well? STUDENT: No. Just [___] BRANDON: Okay. Yeah. All right. Go ahead. STUDENT: Or if they're living in a world that\ndestroys their clothes from living around there constantly, they go put on another pair\nof clothes because the atmosphere disintegrates them. BRANDON: Atmosphere disintegrating your clothes. Are you sure that's not for the romance? CLASS: (laughing) BRANDON: All right. Let's go over here. Go ahead. STUDENT: [___] BRANDON: Oh, cool. Look, listen to this. This is a great idea. Let's quiet down. Cool idea. STUDENT: The murder happened at Comicon, and\nit was Naruto day. BRANDON: Yeah. That's actually genius, right? There was a Naruto cosplayer who committed\nthe murder, but there's 50 of them at the con and we have to try to find them all. That's using fashion perfectly in your story's\nworld building. I love that one. Go ahead. STUDENT: Everyone's wearing the same clothes,\nor the person [___] camouflage. BRANDON: OK. Yeah. You've got a society where people look very\nsimilar to one another. You could even go a step further and say,\nthis is a society of clones. Everybody looks the same. But now you got to figure out which one of\nthese killed someone, if there's specific motivation to one of the clones. Yeah, go ahead. Did you have one? STUDENT: Maybe everybody, or different families\nhave, like, different embroidery they put on their clothes. STUDENT: Oh, like kilts, the tartans. STUDENT: You can trace where some article\nof clothing is from, and maybe they traded them. BRANDON: Right. So what she's saying is there's maybe special\nembroidery that certain families have or things like the tartan. Is it called tartan? Yes. And things like this. Like, you could imagine a detective who is\na fashion expert and solves crimes based on the fashion. Which, there's got to be someone has done\nthis. But I don't know. I'm sure. What's that? STUDENT: Legally Blonde. BRANDON: Legally Blonde is actually a really\ngreat mystery. It's paced very, very well. But something like that, you could totally\nuse. Perfect idea. All right. Let's go to our romance. What are we going to use from around here\nfor our romance? STUDENTS: (calling out ideas) BRANDON: All right. All right. All right. We'll go with military structure. How can you have an interesting military tradition\nor structure and tell a great romance story in it? STUDENT: Lovers have to be star crossed. BRANDON: Lovers have to be star crossed. So--? STUDENT: The military star crosses them. BRANDON: I mean, are you saying that an enlisted\nman falls in love with an officer or something like that? STUDENT: Like, whatever military hierarchy. BRANDON: Yeah. You're breaking the military hierarchy. Or, I mean, the easy go-tos are she's on one\nside of the war and he's on the other. But what can you do that is a different military\ntradition or thing from our world that does not exist in our world that would be distinctive\nfor a fantasy world that would let you tell an interesting romance? All right. Go ahead. STUDENT: Maybe there are different factions\nof the military and they each have honed their craft in their families. And they come from different paths [___]. But which-- BRANDON: Right. Right. STUDENT: Like what culture would you stay\nin. Would you stay in [___]? BRANDON: Right. The assassins are a certain hierarchy in the\nmilitary, and they all intermarry. But suddenly an assassin falls in love with,\nyou know, a dragon rider. Right. OK. OK. Let's go back to you. I haven't had anyone back there. Go ahead. STUDENT: A Jedi can't date ambassadors. BRANDON: Jedi can't date ambassadors. CLASS: (groans and laughs) BRANDON: I don't like sand. CLASS: (laughs) BRANDON: All right. All right. All right. Have you done one yet? You haven't. Right. STUDENT: No. BRANDON: Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: I was going to say, instead of having\ntrial by combat, what if you had romance by combat. BRANDON: Romance by combat. Actually, I've seen good romance stories on\nthis, where it's like-- yeah. Star Trek. But also there's some classic stories about,\nif you want to marry my daughter, you have to defeat my champion. But then the daughter is the champion. Right. That's Brave. But there's also, there's a Greek story that's\nthat, I want to say. Yeah, an old Greek story. But, yeah. Go ahead. STUDENT: Or like the Parshendi war couples. BRANDON: Yeah. STUDENT: In order to be in the military, you\nhave to be married and fight with your spouse. But it's a BYU freshman and he can't find\nhis wife. BRANDON: That's actually a really great idea\nfor a story. It's kind of this thing where you've got like\nthe Pacific Rim where you need a team for some reason to work this military. You could have some Big Mac, where it's like\nthis, and you need to be a pair. I mean, it works very interestingly in Dragonriders\nof Pern, where if your dragons hook up, it's kind of almost impossible for you to not hook\nup with the person that is the other dragon because of the way that the bond between human\nand dragon works, which is also kind of the same but different sort of idea. There's so many things you could do there. So. Yeah. Great, wonderful idea. You should write that story. That'd be a great story. Yes. All right. Let's do a horror. Who wants to pick the horror one? STUDENT: Economics. STUDENT: Tectonics. BRANDON: Economics. Economics. I love it. All right. Oh, someone's really excited. STUDENT: The corona virus destroys China,\nand so the economy is in chaos. BRANDON: OK. OK. The corona virus, it destroys China. So the economy is in chaos? How else could you use economy to enhance\na horror story. We're going to go in the back over here. STUDENT: A certain monster is chasing you,\nand if you have the money, you can buy the solution to whatever the monster. You can buy a gun. BRANDON: OK. Monster is chasing you. You can use money to make the monster not\nchase you in some way. Maybe you can buy off the people who have\nsent the monster against you, and it goes to someone else. Maybe you have to be on the that the monster\nis going to kill. But you can put a whole bunch of people by\npaying it on the list before you. And if you can fill the list with enough people\nfor it to kill, that will never get to you, then you're in good shape. Yeah. Go ahead. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. STUDENT: How about you have some races infiltrated\nand they took over all of the major stock markets, and then it turned out that they\ncame to the planet and took over. BRANDON: Right. Alien invasion via stock market first. Like this. Over here in the red hat. STUDENT: Adam Smith's invisible hand that\ncontrols the economy actually is a real hand. BRANDON: (laughing) Gold star. Gold star. OK, people who haven't done one yet. People who haven't done one yet. Go ahead. STUDENT: Like in The Monkey's Paw, there was\nan economic pressure that made them make terrible decisions. BRANDON: Yeah. Yeah. Monkey's Paw. Economic pressure making people make terrible\ndecisions is a mainstay of horror. Yeah. Go ahead. Back here. STUDENT: It's April 16th, the day after tax\nday. And you wake up and they're not done. CLASS: (laughing) BRANDON: Yeah. Yeah. OK. Isaac's got one. Isaac, what you got? STUDENT: It's a world where people have horrible,\ndebilitating nightmares. But you can get out of it if you get into\na higher tax bracket. BRANDON: (laughing) That's a little more dystopian\nthan it is horror. But yeah. OK. All right. We'll do a couple more. Go ahead. STUDENT: Everyone's a contract killer. BRANDON: Everyone's a contract killer. Hey, way to bring it back around to John Wick. Yeah. CLASS: (laughing) STUDENT: Hiring your neighbor to kill the\nperson across the street. BRANDON: Yeah. I mean, the purge is basically an economic,\nor political, social hierarchy driven horror series. And that kind of plays along those sorts of\nsame ideas. Go ahead. STUDENT: Super rich people can buy you so\nthey can hunt you down. BRANDON: Yeah. Yeah. Dangerous Game. Super rich people have a way that they can\nhunt you down. Let's go ahead. Well, we'll wrap these up. We could go on and on and on, I'm sure. So why do I do this exercise? Well, the point of this exercise is to point\nout we could take one of these things and we can riff on it to the point that that one\nthing, changed in an interesting way, can make your whole fantasy story. Because of that, you don't need all of this. It is good to be aware of the different options\nthat are available to you. But it's also really important to pick a narrow\nfocus for most of your stories. OK? And the sub-genre you're in, again, will let\nyou determine how many of these things you do. But remember Rule Number Three. One of these done really well is almost always\nbetter than trying to do 5% of all of them. Now, a lot of times, what I will do is I will\npick, for instance, weather, the high storms in Roshar. I'm like, all right, I'm writing epic fantasy. I've got a lot of worldbuilding points. This is my focus and physical setting. There's a magical hurricane that hits the\nworld every couple of days. Now, what I want to do is I want to interconnect\nit. And if there's one thing I want you to take\nfrom this particular lesson, it is that picking an idea and then interconnecting it into the\nrest is a lot of times the best way to create an epic fantasy or epic science fiction. If you say, okay, weather is our focus, that,\nof course, is going to influence our climate, obviously. How can I have the weather then influence\nmy flora and fauna? Because what happens then is you're spending\nyour world building time on the storm and how society reacts to this storm. Then when you mentioned some little thing,\noh, yeah, these animals have a lifecycle that uses the storm, the reader says, \"Wow, that's\nso expansive.\" Because their imagination then takes that\nand runs with it all along the directions you want them to. By showing one small thing, one small effect,\ndone really well, about how the worldbuilding works, your reader will add so much more to\nyou. And then when you say, all right, I'm going\nto make sure the weather is tied into the magic somehow, because this is our major worldbuilding\ntheme, that's where Stormlight comes from. If you haven't read the books, the storm deposit's\nmagical energy, which you can use to fuel your magic. No storms, no magic. Therefore, whether or not you're able to use\nthe magic as much as you want is based on how often the storms are coming through and\nyour ability to tap into that. And so suddenly we start reaching and saying,\nall right, how does this affect our religion? How does this affect our government? How does this affect our economics? Not all of it interconnects. Once in a while, I'll pick a few things and\nsay, OK, gender roles in this world are really wonky compared to, you know, what your average\nAmerican's gender roles would look like. Women can read. Men are forbidden. What does that do? And then I start to look at say, all right,\nhow does this affect this? How does this affect this? How does this go here? Why do women wear one of their sleeves covering\none of their hands? Well-- STUDENT: Why? BRANDON: Why do they. Well, the actual answer is, I think taboos\nare really interesting, and when I was in Korea, you didn't show the bottom of your\nfoot to people. It was considered very taboo, which was just\nbizarre to me. And I thought human beings have really weird\nand interesting taboos. There are certain tribes in South America\nthat walk about naked as we would see it, but they don't consider it naked because they\nhave their gourd on that is covering a certain part of their male anatomy, just a bit of\nit, but enough that it's not considered naked. And we look at them like they're just naked. They're like, no, I'm not. I'm perfectly well clothed. Taboos are really fascinating to me. And so I wanted a fantastical taboo. That's why it happened. Now, my explanation in world was that there\nwas a really influential piece of writing a long time ago where a philosopher said,\n\"Well, all the true feminine arts are one handed,\" and refined women can paint and do\nmusic and do art and all these things, but all masculine skills require two hands and\nthey're like smashing swords against each other and things like that. And so refined society began to take this\nless as one philosopher's random thing that she came up with, which is actually not all\nthat accurate, and then started imposing social mores to reinforce behavior as what happens. And then Shardblades and Shardplate got abandoned\nin large numbers. And when you're in Shardplate, it doesn't\nmatter if you're male or female. Because if a man has an average strength of\nnine and a woman has an average strength of seven and a Shardplate adds 50, then it doesn't\nreally matter anymore who's in that Shardplate in relative strength. And so certain factions started using this\nas the social structure, an excuse to keep women and basically eliminate 50 percent of\nthe competition for their Shardplate. But this doesn't matter so much as doing something\nthat feels like it works in the society that I'm writing. Your explanations are not as important necessarily\nas making it feel real. Remind me next week if I have time. One thing I missed from this lecture we didn't\nget to is internal logic versus external logic. And we will talk about that another week. For now, go forth, build some worlds. CLASS: (applause)"}, "7": {"0": " BRANDON: Everyone give a warm welcome to Mary\nRobinette. CLASS: (applause)\nMARY ROBINETTE: Thanks. Brandon invited me here to talk to you about\nshort stories, because he is good at many things . . . that are not short stories. I know, it's shocking. I write a lot of short stories. But the thing that you should understand is\nthat writing is fractal. Once you understand how something works at\none length, you can actually apply it to other lengths, as long as you understand the principles\nthat are involved. If it's something that works in a paragraph\nlevel, you can scale it down to sentence, up to chapter, scene, or five-volume monstrosity.", "45": " What is a short story? Now, I'm not talking about the market definition,\nbut about the reader experience. Short stories are about delivering a specific\nemotional punch. It's a specific experience. Novels are about immersion. This is an important distinction to understand,\nthat when readers pick up a piece of fiction, they're picking it up because they want to\neffect a change in their brain. They want to have an emotional experience,\nand they want a specific ride. So novel readers, the analogy that I use is\nthat it's like two different modes of watching the Olympics. You can watch the Olympics, like WATCH the\nOlympics. You watch the pre-show stuff. You watch all of the Road to the Olympics\nwith the fancy music and people running in the background, the heartfelt things about\nsomeone's mom and how they drove them in the dark to whatever it is. You watch all of the different athletes in\nwhatever competition it is that you are totally invested in. Even if there's one gymnast that you are there\nfor, you watch the competition, because you want to know. Then your gymnast goes out and they do their\nflippy flippy routine, and it's amazing, and they stick the landing. Then there's the hugging with the coach, and\nthen there's the medals ceremony. And then there's the post-show interview,\nwhich is the denouement, and you have watched the Olympics. That's a novel. A short story is, someone has forwarded you\na YouTube clip of the gymnast doing the flippy flippy routine, and you watch it, and it begins\nright before they flip, and it ends when they stick the landing. You have watched the Olympics. Very different experiences. But you're reading them, or watching them,\nfor different things. In one case, you just want that punch, that\nexcitement of watching someone stick the landing and doing something exceptional. In the other you want this long, immersive\nthing. With a short story, it's that quick fix, and\nthat's an important thing to understand. Now we get to some structure. Ready? We have the MICE Quotient. Whee! Okay. The MICE Quotient is an organizational theory\nthat explains pretty much every story, fiction and nonfiction. I'm going to talk about this through a lens\nof fiction, but I'll let you know that if you have to write an essay it works for nonfiction\ntoo. Now stories are made up of, click, four elements:\nmilieu, inquiry, character, and event, mixed in different proportions. These elements can help you determine where\na story starts and stops, and the kind of conflicts that your characters face. Click. A milieu story begins when your character\nenters a place, and it ends with your character exits the place. These are things like Gulliver's Travels,\nAround the World in 80 Days, classic examples. Click. Knowing where milieu stories end, this also\ntells you the kind of conflicts that go in the middle, because your job as a writer is\nto figure out what your character needs to do, and then systematically prevent them from\nreaching the goal. The moment that goal is reached; the story\nis over. So you are just mean. Click. Milieu conflict, if it ends when you exit\na place, all of the stuff in the middle is about difficulty with navigating that space. It's people getting confused about finding\nthe exit. It's trouble surviving in the place. It's attempting to navigate. Anything around place is going to be milieu,\nanything where you're struggling with the space you're in.", "292": " Inquiry stories, click. Inquiry stories are driven by questions. They begin when a character has a question. \"Huh?\" And they end when they answer it. \"Aha!\" These are, it's a super complicated structure. But it's things like Sherlock Holmes, murder\nmysteries. These are classic inquiry stories. Click. For an inquiry conflict, your goal is to keep\nyour character from finding the answer.", "317": " They're lied to. They can't understand the answer. The answer leads to a dead end. Those are what red herrings are. Click. Character stories. Character stories are driven by angst. \"Oh, my life is so hard!\" In the simplest form, they begin when a character\nis unhappy with themselves, and they end when they're happy. \"Ah, I'll never be popular.\" \"Now I'm popular!\" But really they begin with an identify shift,\na shift in how the character self-defines, and they end when the character's self-definition\nsolidifies, when they have a new understanding of self. So these are coming-of-age stories, romances. Those are classic character stories. Click. Your character is trying to change. Stop them. Don't let them break out of their role. Fill them with self-loathing. Have the change backfire. Those are character stories.", "385": " Now event stories, click, are driven by action. These begin when the status quo, or the sense\nof normal, is disrupted, and they're restored when there's a new status quo. And by the way, yes, \"everyone dies\" does\ncount as a new status quo. But it is very much an external threat. Character is internal. This is external. So by this point you understand the drill. Click. Don't let your character restore the status\nquo. You have fight scenes. You have chase scenes. You have explosions. You have mor disruptions to status quo. Again, you're just mean. That is your job. Click. Super easy to confuse character and event. Character story is interior. I'll never be popular. Event story is external. Asteroid coming at the earth. If the asteroid is thinking \"I'll never be\npopular,\" the asteroid is having a character story. OK. Click. So that's what individual MICE elements look\nlike, but you almost never see a single thread story. Most stories are made up of multiple threads,\nbecause single thread stories are really boring. Click. How do you do it? Now, for a lot of people in the room, this\nwill explain how you do it. For those of you who do not do computers,\nlet me give you a different analogy. This is nesting code. If you open milieu, and then you open inquiry,\nyou have to close the inquiry before you can close the milieu. If you think about it as getting a box, and\nthe box is labeled \"Milieu\" on the outside of it, and you open it up and there are a\nbunch of milieu toys, and then inside is a smaller box filled with inquiry toys. And you open that up and you pull out those\ninquiry toys, and then you play with all of them while you're telling your story. And then at the end of the day you have to\nput them back in the box. So you want to put the inquiry ones back into\nthat smaller box so it will fit inside the larger box of the milieu. It's kind of like trying to return something\nto Ikea after you've-- if you don't get it all back in the box, you wind up with that\nextra piece, and why are there so many Allen wrenches? To use a concrete example, click, Wizard of\nOz is a beautifully nested story. It begins as a character story. Click. Dorothy is dissatisfied with her role as a\nKansas farm girl. Then we open the event. Tornado! Then we open the milieu. \"Welcome to Oz.\" And then we open the inquiry. \"What do the ruby slippers do?\" Click. At the end of the story, Glenda arrives and\nsays, \"Oh, the ruby slippers will carry you home. Oh.\" Which, honestly, she could have said at the\nbeginning. It would have saved everybody a lot of time. But it does close the inquiry. Then we close the milieu by Dorothy leaving\nOz. And then we close the event by arriving back\nin Kansas, where the status quo has been restored. And then Dorothy says, \"I didn't need to go\nlooking any farther for adventure than my own backyard,\" closing the character. When you have stories, click, that feel like\nthey end, and then end again, and then end again, not thinking of any films in particular,\nit's often because that ending sequence is out of sync. One of the things that actually happens to\nthis one is it is closing out things in a faithful order, to a film that you haven't\nseen in quite some time. That's one of the reasons it feels out of\nsync. The other thing that will happen is, you remember\nthose boxes? If you think about it instead as actual thread,\nor a piece of elastic, the longer I'm stretching that piece of elastic, the more tension it's\nunder, so when I release it it's releasing more energy. That piece of thread, that elastic thread,\nis your reader's attention. So the longer that attention has been under\nstress, the more the cathartic release you're going to get at the end. If you release something early, you don't\nactually have enough time to get another piece of thread up to that same tension, because\nyou aren't spending as much time with it, which is why sometimes a story will feel like\nit just fizzles out. That's the end of the PowerPoint. All right, so, we're going to write a story,\nin class, today.", "678": " OK. You're like, \"Wait. Wait. I didn't sign up for-- I signed up for a lecture\nclass.\" OK. We're going to write a 250, approximate, approximately\n250-word piece of flash fiction. And the reason I'm having you do this is that,\nagain, once you understand how this works, you can unpack it. But I often find that the easiest way to understand\nsomething is to just put it into effect. Brandon, I want you to try this too. BRANDON: I just sat down with my laptop. MARY ROBINETTE: Perfect.", "716": " OK. So the opening. The opening is where we meet our character\nand make promises for our readers. I'm going to talk about the things that you\nneed to establish. But the order in which you need to establish\nit is up to you. The key here is that your reader wants to\nbe oriented. In your first three sentences, who, where,\ngenre. That's it. Who, where, and genre. Now, there's a bunch of different types of\nopening. I will be clear that the type that we're doing\nright now is something that's called an action-driven", "760": " opening. Speaking of action. To make things simple, I'm going to wind up\nassigning you some things. I'm going to assign you a character, I'm going\nto assign you an object, and I'm going to go ahead and give you a genre, just to make\nit so that you don't have to pick quite so many things in this moment. But if you want to do something else, that's\nalso fair game. The things that you're going to be doing is\nthat you are going to be using, your genre is science fiction. Your character is a jockey. Is it like a horse? Possible. It could be a disc jockey. It could be karaoke jockey. This is where you get your freedom, is you\nget to define what jockey means in this context. And coaster. Could be a coaster that set a beverage on. It could be a roller coaster. It could be-- you know, so any of those things. Science fiction, jockey, coaster. OK? Now, before you start, let me give you just\na little bit more to help you out. I said that you need to establish where. This is your location. Your reader wants to be grounded about where\nthey are. For the location, I want you to link to a\nsensory detail. Rather than, \"She stood in the battleship's\nengine room,\" which does tell me the location, you're going for something more like, \"The\nthrum of the battleship's engines resonated through her feet.\" Does that make sense? For your location, I want a sensory detail. For your character you're going to be wanting\nto use point of view, how the character sees and interacts with the world. One of the easy things you can do kind of\nin your own brain is to define a shorthand", "895": " for the character. It could be something like, sexist boss, spunky\npirate, angsty teenage jockey. Although, let's be honest, when we're teenagers\nit's just angsty all the time, so I could have just said teenage jockey there. But something that gives you an idea of what\ntheir attitude is. That's the piece you're looking for. I've already defined that you've got jockey. You get to put the adjective that defines\ntheir attitude in front of that for yourself. Does that make sense? The way you're going to explain that to me\nwith the who is that you're going to give me their action. What are they doing? What is the thing that they're doing? What is the action that they're taking? Does that make sense? Then the genre, you want to get in a genre-specific\ndetail as fast as you can. This is going to be something specific and\nunique. \"Thrum of battleship's engines,\" sounds specific,\nnot unique. If I said, \"The thrum of the battleship's\nwarp core drive,\" that gives you a much more specific thing. \"The thrum of the battleship's steam engine\nthrough its iron-clad walls,\" gives you a different specific, unique detail. Does that make sense? OK. So you have three sentences to do this. Bonus points if you can do it in one. And this does not mean long sentences. This means specific sentences. You have three minutes. That's a minute per sentence, which is a luxury. All right, time is up. It's okay. I know that some of you are going to keep\nwriting while I'm lecturing. I am comfortable with this. My example-- You're all looking at the math\nequation that I put on the board with fear. I know. I'll explain it in a second. So here's my example. Two sentences, because I was going for the\nbonus points. \"Hydraulic fluid dripped out of the roller\ncoaster\u2019s AI straight onto Chelsea's jockey I.D. Where the heck was that leak?\" So, what do we have? We have roller coaster, \"roller coaster's\nAI,\" so that's my genre-specific detail. \"Straight onto Chelsea's jockey badge.\" So she's underneath it. So you've got location and character. And \"Where the heck was that leak\" tells you\na little bit about what she's trying to do, which is to fix the leak. But it also is giving you a little bit of\nher attitude, that she's cranky. Make sense? OK. In three sentences, you shouldn't have had\nroom to get into trouble, yet, with this other thing that happens with short stories, which\nis that you try to put too much in. For our purposes, you are going to be allowed\ntwo characters and one location. No more than two characters. Let me explain why through this magical thing.", "1137": " Terrifying. The length of your story is equal to the number\nof characters, plus the number of stages, or scenes, scenic locations, times 750 words,\ntimes the number of MICE threads you have, divided by 1.5. Why is it like that? Let me explain. Each character or location you add has the\npotential to add, on average, 500 to 1,000 words to your scene or story. You can do it with less, but this danger is\nthere. Every time you put a character in, they cost\nsomething from your word budget. Every time you put in a scenic location, it\ncosts something from your word budget, because you have to spend words to describe them. So since it's 500 to 1,000, 750 is the average\nof that. So this is, you add up the number of characters\nand the number of stages or scenic locations, and then you multiply it by 750 words. Each MICE Quotient thread has the potential\nto make your story half again as long. Yeah. The reason is because you have to keep it\nalive every single time, all the way through that story. When you multiply it by MICE, the number of\nMICE threads you have, let's say you have three MICE threads, you'd multiply it by three. This dividing by 1.5 does the mathematical\ntrick of making it half again as long instead of three times as long. Does that make sense? In theory? This is useful as a diagnostic tool. It's useful as a predictor, a rough predictor. Like, if I have a story and I'm like, \"This\nis a story about eight brothers who are on a quest across America, stopping at five different\ntheme parks,\" That is not a 250-word story. It makes it super easy to spot. It is not perfect. It's a rough rule-of-thumb predictor, but\nit's a useful thing. For ours, because we're going to try to keep\nit to 250 words, you have a maximum of two characters and one location. You see how you're already in danger if you\nhave two characters? So try to keep it short. Your next sentence is going to be about--\nwe're going to introduce our conflict. Conflicts are all about your character trying\nto achieve a goal and failing to achieve the goal. This is why it's called a try-fail cycle. Try. Fail. In a short story, and sometimes a novel too,\nI would normally ask you to give me that first conflict within the first 13 lines. But in a piece of flash fiction, for our purposes\nof this exercise, you get two sentences, and those are your next two sentences. Your next two sentences are, what is your\ncharacter trying to do and why? That's the setup of your try-fail cycle. That's the thing they are trying to do. And then, once we know what they're trying\nto do, what is stopping them? What is stopping them? Now for flash fiction, one of the tricks that\nyou can do is to have several of the try-fail cycles be implied as happening before the\nscene starts. I will give you an example of mine, and then\nI will let you dive in and try your own. \"Where the heck was that leak? If she didn't manage to get the coaster back\nonline before the race,\" this is what she's trying to do, get the coaster back online,\n\"she'd have to forfeit her entry money.\" There is the why. And I'm at BYU. \"Not a gosh darn suggestion from the trouble\nshooter on her heads-up display had isolated the problem.\" Which implies that she has already done some\ntrouble shooting before it starts. Do you understand what I mean about the implication,\nwhich is useful in flash fiction? You are, again, you're going to write me two\nsentences. Any questions about the sentences that you're\nwriting? What is your character trying to do and why? What is the barrier? What is stopping them from doing that thing? All right? Once again, two sentences, a minute per sentence. You can do it. Luxury. Now we're going to start throwing conflicts\nat them. What I want you to do is look at what you've\ngot on the page, and I want you to identify the MICE Quotient element. Are they trying to escape from something? Are they trying to navigate in a place? If they are, then you've got a milieu. How many people have a milieu going on? OK, cool. Are they trying to answer a question? If they are, then you've got an inquiry story\ngoing on. How many people are trying to answer a question? OK. Are they unhappy with themselves, angsty? Then you have a character story. How many character story people? Yep. And are they trying to change the status quo\nor sense of normal, change the world. Event stories. OK. I'm unsurprised. That means you know what kind of conflict\nto throw at them. If it's a milieu story, for those of you that\nhave it, stop them from getting to wherever it is that they're trying to go, whether that's\ngetting out of a thing, or getting into a thing. Stop them from that. Stop them from crossing that threshold. If it's an inquiry, block them from answering\ntheir questions. Character, make them unhappier. An event story, more things go wrong. Here's the trick. When something fails, they try a different\napproach.", "1530": " That's what the try-fail cycle is. Again, your job as the author is to knock\nthe character down and pick them up again. I'll just note that asking a question and\ngetting snubbed, it doesn't have to be a big try-fail cycle, just an asking and getting\nsnubbed is a try-fail cycle. Each action that your character takes should\nhave a consequence. We usually describe this as yes, but/no, and. \"Yes, but\" means that they made progress towards\ntheir goal, but they were pushed back from it. \"No, and\" means they did not make progress\ntowards their goal, and they were pushed farther back from it. What we do here is we-- let me use an example. In Star Wars, rescuing the princess is a milieu\nthread, while being chased by Vader, or the Storm Troopers, being chased, they jump into\nthe-- it's like, are they going to get out. That's the basic question. Are they going to get off the ship? What's the first thing they try? Jumping down a chute. Does that work? Yes, but it's a garbage chute. So what's the next thing they try? Blaster. Does shooting a blaster at the walls work. No, and it wakes up a creature underneath\nthe-- the water thingies. Are they able to deal with the creature? Yes, but only because the walls of the trash\ncompacter start coming in. So you understand what I'm talking about here? What you're going to be looking for here is\na try-fail cycle for your character. Try to just give them one, where they try\nsomething and it fails, and things are a little bit worse. You can have it succeed and things still get\nworse. But try for a failure, a straight-up failure,\nand \"and things get worse.\" Does that make sense? OK. For this one, whoa! I'm giving you five whole sentences and five\nminutes. Again, luxury. All right. Here's how mine shook out. And again, I know some of you will contrast\nwriting while I read. I'm comfortable with that. So she had the heads-up display in our previous\nthing, when I established the problem. She was trying to find the thing. \"Fine. It was time to improvise.\" So that's the thing she's trying. She's improvising. \"Chelsea stuck her hand into the AI's guts\nand traced the slippery fluid up as far as she could go. The interior of the roller coaster was still\ncold from sitting overnight in the cryo bay. Condensation clung to the walls and mixed\nwith the hydraulic fluid coating her fingers. She closed her eyes, trying to imagine,\" I'm\nbeing very blatant here. \"She closed her eyes, trying to imagine the\ninterior, as she ran past the junction box, AND sudden heat stung her fingers. Chelsea jerked back, cracking her head on\nthe toolbox behind her. 'Gosh darn it all to heck!'\" CLASS: (laughter)\nMARY ROBINETTE: But you see what I did there? There's a thing she tried, and it failed,\nand things have now gotten a little bit worse, because she has shocked herself and hit her\nhead. Does that make sense? So you understand also proportionally what\nhas happened to your story is that the beginning is, at this point, about the first third. You've got your set-up right there proportionally. Then we've spent more words on that try-fail\ncycle than we did on the set-up. Does that make sense? You can see the proportions starting to take\nplace there. Now we start into the end of the middle.", "1813": " The try-fail cycle is the middle. The end of the middle is where we're coming\nout of this. It's about the two-third or three-quarter\nmark in most things. You ask questions. You open up problems. You make things worse. Then you start to resolve them. You start to close those story questions. This is why you always bog down, by the way,\nat the two-third/three-quarter mark, because you're changing mode. Interestingly, there is a phenomenon in psychology\ncalled the three-quarter effect, that when someone is doing something, at about the three-quarter\npoint is when it seems like they can't possibly finish it. Part of what's going on apparently, mentally,\nis that you assume you have that much longer to go, instead of realizing you only have\na quarter of the time to go. That's some of what's happening. But most of it is that you're changing mode\nfrom starting things to ending things. So how do you do that? The conflicts, yes, but/no. The resolutions . . . are going to be in blue,\nand very large. The resolutions are . . . faint. Yes, and. Because that's a movement towards the goal\nand a continuation towards the goal. And represents continuing in the same direction\nin many ways. Excuse me, yes, that. This marker is terrible. Can she write on the board? I have no comments at all on that, because\nI know whose guest room I'm staying in. No, but. That means there's been a reversal that they\ndidn't do the thing, but they still get something towards the goal. That would be something like, a \"yes, and\"\nwould be, are they able to-- someone is hungry. Are they able to buy lunch? Yes, and it came with an extra order of churros. \"No, but\" would be something like, they're\ntrying to diffuse the bomb. Are they able to? No, but when it explodes it goes out the window\nand lands on the bad guy. Thank you. I mean, those are terrible examples, but you\nunderstand what I mean. So you're going to switch to closing mode.", "1986": " This means that the next try-fail cycle that\nyour character does is going to be a try-succeed. Whatever it is that they do is going to solve\nthe problem. Now in a story, or a novel that's more than\n250-ish words, you would do multiples of those iterations, getting them closer to the goal\neach time you would iterate it. In our case, because we're doing a piece of\nflash fiction, we're going to solve the problem right now. Does that make sense? And again, you get about five sentences to\nsolve this sucker. OK? If you can do it in less, that's great. So I'm giving you another five minutes. Here's how mine plays out. She has cracked her head on the toolbox behind\nher. \"Gosh darn it all to heck! Shaking her hand, she glowered at the roller\ncoaster. 'You know, if I have to forfeit this entry\nmoney, I'm going to have to sell you just to pay rent, and you'll probably wind up in\nscrap.' She reached into the chassis again. 'Please, please let me find the leak.' Her heads-up display lit up with what looked\nlike a diagnostic message, from the AI that was supposedly offline. 'The leak is from the thermal coupler in my\nright braking mechanism, but fluid dynamics make it appear to come from the manifold.' Chelsea's mouth dropped open. 'If you knew that all along--?'\" OK. So you see what I did? I just-- the next thing she tried worked. So now we have to end it, because that's not\nan ending, right? The problem is solved, but it's not satisfying\nyet. In the ending, we aim towards closing out\nthe MICE elements we opened. We're talking about big elements. You open lots of small ones in there as well. But you want to nest them, the way we were\ntalking about. If you've got multiple threads going on, you\nwant to make sure that you close them out so that they all fit neatly back into their\nbox. You're mirroring the ending, which also means\nthat you're going to mirror those-- if you think about it as mirroring those last three\nsentences, that you actually need the same things. We need to know who, where, and genre or mood. Things have shifted over the course of the\nstory. So you want to ground the reader by making\nsure that they understand what has shifted, that you kind of draw a line under it. Hitting those points again will help us see\nthe change. For the who, we're going to again use an action\nor reflection, the character actively thinking about something specific. For the where, often a sensory detail. Again, if you look at the beginning, sometimes\npulling a sensory detail from there is useful. And genre, something specific. In this case when I say genre, I'm really\nthinking more about the mood, because often the tone has changed. Like, if the character starts in a very happy\nplace and you're writing a tragedy, and it ends in a tragic place, which is why it's\ncalled a tragedy, you would want the mood to be different at the end than it is at the\nbeginning. So you want to express that with the words\nand the language structure that you use. I'm going to read you my example, and then\nI'm going to give you three sentences to wrap up your story. \"Chelsea's mouth dropped. 'If you knew that all along--' She closed\nher eyes, cursing her own stupidity. Three years as an AI jockey and you'd think\nthat she would remember that even in a roller coaster, the temperamental things needed the\nmagic word. Next time she'd say please sooner.\" OK. Now it feels like it's over, right? It's that mirroring that I'm doing. So, you've got three sentences to wrap that\nup. Make sure that I know where my character is\nnow, emotionally. If they have changed place, if you're in a\nmilieu, make sure that I know where that new place is. Give me a little bit of mood and that genre-specific\ndetail, with the thing that makes it feel specific to the story. Three sentences, three minutes. All right. The rules that I was giving you about three\nsentences, five sentences, those are rules of thumb. That's an easy goal for you to hit. In the real world it's going to be more flexible\nthan that. But it's something that's achievable. How many people have something that now has\na beginning, middle, and an end? Great. Ah ha! Did you actually write a 250-word short story? BRANDON: It's 650. CLASS: (laughter)\nMARY ROBINETTE: Still-- I take great pride in the fact that that is probably the shortest\nstory you've ever written. BRANDON: Yeah. MARY ROBINETTE: But you can see how you can\ntake the principles from doing this exercise and apply them at a longer length, the proportional\nidea of what these stories look like, what each of those pieces are doing. You can probably see how, if you put another\npiece of MICE element in there that you would then have to establish two problems at the\nbeginning, rather than just one, or you'd establish one problem, then a little bit later\nyou'd introduce the other one, and that that's, again, going to make the story proportionally\nlonger when you do that. We now have six minutes for questions. Any questions? About-- Yes. STUDENT: I guess, how do you-- I guess, the\nmodel of, like, opening and closing with, like, the same conflicts works really well. But I guess I'm curious about, what if your\nstory, like, changes direction. Like, say, the characters start out to do\nsomething, and then realize something about themselves or something about the nature of\nthe conflict that causes their goal to change, and what they're trying to accomplish is different\nfrom what it was at the beginning? MARY ROBINETTE: So what happens when the goal\nchanges part way through the story? One of the things is that you would actually\nwant to sign post that a little bit to the readers that this might happen. I do that by basically having something that\nis thematically linked to the goal that they will eventually solve. If my character is-- the end of the story\nis going to be my character saving the world, but the beginning of the story is them trying\nto become comfortable with themselves, I would still start with some disruption to their\nlife, some external disruption, to indicate that there are going to be events-- that there's\na status quo disruption, a larger one coming. Does that make sense? That's one thing that you would do. The other thing is that as they're going through,\nmake sure that whatever that initial one that they started with was, that you still do close\nit out. For instance, if I start and my character\nis like, \"Why is this dead body on the floor? My husband has been killed. Oh, my tragedy as a widow and the death of\nmy husband.\" The detective comes in and they're working\ntogether to solve this crime. Then the detective and widow fall in love,\nand she wasn't looking for love, but now she's found it and they get married and live happily\never after. And we don't know who killed that man? OK. You understand the problems? STUDENT: Yes. MARY ROBINETTE: OK, great. Anybody else? Yes. STUDENT: I don't know if there's a hard and\nfast rule for this. With longer short fiction, would you still\ntry to establish, like, genre within the first three sentences? MARY ROBINETTE: The question was, in longer\nform, would I still try to establish it within the first three sentences? I do. The reason is because, when the reader starts,\nthey have no information at all. So they need-- the longer it takes to ground\nthem, the slower the story is going to feel, and the longer it's going to take-- the more\nlikely they are to put it down if they're confused. So I do try to get it within the first three\nsentences. But I don't try to-- don't feel like you have\nto be super specific. Like, if you're doing a cryptocurrency noir\nmurder mystery on an interplanetary cruise ship, I don't need to know all of that in\nthe first three sentences. I just need to know, \"Oh, it looks like we're\ninto the future thing-ish.\" OK? Yeah. STUDENT: If it's urban fantasy, what's a good\nway to do [inaudible]. MARY ROBINETTE: Urban fantasy is a good question. One of the tricky things with magic, in urban\nfantasy in particular, is that often when you introduce magic, people will think it's\nin the past, and if you introduce techy, people will think magic isn't going to happen. So trying to do both at the same time, if\nyou can, in the three sentences, is great. However, often with urban fantasy, you're\ndealing with a character who is unaware of the fantastical world. So that gets a little harder. That's one of those places where you are,\nto some degree, relying on where you're shelved in the bookstore. But you would still want to establish, this\nis-- you'd still want people to know what time they're in, so that there's only one\nof those two things that's going to be a surprise when it changes. Does that make sense? All right. One minute. I'm going to turn it back to Brandon. BRANDON: I'm just going to say thank you to\nMary Robinette. CLASS: (applause)\nMARY ROBINETTE: (inaudible) BRANDON: We will have this on the YouTube\nchannel if you want to watch through it again. But good job, guys. I expect you all to sell flash fiction pieces\nnow. CLASS: (laughter)"}, "8": {"0": " BRANDON: Guys, you get me back this week.\nYay! CLASS: [cheering]\nBRANDON: Don't sound too enthusiastic. This week we are doing Q&A from the things you\nturned in on world building. All right? Next week we will start into character. We'll do\ntwo weeks on character. Then we'll have two weeks on the business of writing, and there's\nprobably a Q&A, time for a Q&A on character in there. I don't know how many weeks we have\nleft. Isaac, how many weeks do we have left of the class after this one?\nISAAC: Today is the 7th. BRANDON: Thirteen, so there's six left? Ish.\nIf you're wondering, if you're already overachieving, there is no final in this class. Don't worry\nabout that. We used to watch a movie and have pizza for final, but then it just ran afoul\nof so many people's plans and my plans usually that we stopped doing that. I'm sorry.\nCLASS: [moaning] BRANDON: Aww! And then they have, like, don't\neat any food in the auditorium, so we don't want to get in trouble, right?\nCLASS: [laughing] BRANDON: We're all law-abiding citizens. I\ndon't have a thing of water right over there. All right let's go to your questions about\nworld building. By the way, there are questions in here that aren't on world building. I usually\nskip over those, and I'll try to have a just general Q&A at the end for things we don't\nget. But a lot of these are about character and stuff that, theoretically, we will get\nto as the class progresses.", "93": " First question asks, \"What flaws do you have\nthat make you a better writer?\" It's a very good question. I'll try not to be insulted.\nIt's actually an excellent question because looking at this sort of thing does really\nhelp understand flaws and limitations and things like that. I think naturally, as a\nwriter, one of my greatest strengths was also one of my greatest flaws, which is often the\nway it is. In fact, if you can write your characters that way, it is usually a good\nidea. For me, this was my ability to write fast and my eagerness to work on new projects.\nWhat this did during my early days as a writer is it pulled me through a lot of books. I\ngot through those bad words, those terrible words, that writers often have when they're\nnewer. I got to experiment a lot with stories. I wrote 13 novels in 10 years. This was a\ngood strength to me. It helped me build confidence. It helped me build momentum.\nIt was also a drawback in that I did not ever learn revision. The biggest thing that held\nme back from getting published was the ability to take an okay or good story and turn it\ninto a great story. That is a separate and important skill. Sometimes as a writer who--\nthere are some of you in this class that are like me. You are overachievers in regards\nto word counts. One of the dangers of this is taking bad habits\nand perpetuating them so long that it's that much harder to break you out of those bad\nhabits later on, particularly prose-wise, things like that. Writing with flabby prose,\nwriting with using the same three metaphors over and over again, writing using cliched\nterms and things like this. If you just get into that habit and you write two million\nwords that way, it's that much harder to break you out.\nFor me, that was a drawback, and also revision. I kept thinking, I'd get feedback on a book\nfrom my readers, I'd send it around and I'd be like, \"Wow, there's so much wrong with\nthis book. How about I just write a better one next time that doesn't have all these\nproblems?\" Well, that was not the right way of looking at it, at least after I entered\nmy journeyman stage as a writer. After I got my first couple of bad books--\nI say bad books. They're actually not terrible, and the books that you're writing aren't terrible.\nBut there are certain things you generally can't learn about constructing a plot and\nhow to make payoffs happen until you just get some fluency with writing endings. For\nmost of us that means writing a number of stories till you start to get a feel for how\nthe beats of a story work in the type of story you're writing. And then learning to take\nthose books and make them better is just really, really handy.\nIf we have time today, I'll launch into a little mini lecture on revision, to talk about\nhow I do it, and how I know some other do it different strategies for that, like I did\nprose last time with Q&A, or descriptions. All right. \"How do you create a magic that\ndoesn't seem like magic?\" This is actually a really interesting question,\nbecause I do think that in a lot of books you have a magic system, even when you don't\nhave a magic system. Like, when I use the term magic, I'm also referring to most technology\nand most science fiction books, and I'm just also kind of talking about the fundamental\nrules of how things work. You might say that a lot of spy thrillers\ndon't have a magic system. But to me, I kind of regard them as happening in \"spy world\"\nwhere there are certain foundational understandings, where it's like, the way that gadgets work,\nthe way that everyone always betrays you. I've talked about this idea. Like, there's\nan aesthetic. That's part of, I think, the magic system for me.\nHow do you make a magic system that doesn't feel like a magic system? One way is you make\nit technology. Science fiction, with a few exceptions of people who really knew their\nstuff, like Arthur C. Clarke, is generally not actually going to be real science. It's\ngoing to be fantastical science. So let's talk a little bit along these lines.\nI promised you guys, I think, I'd talk about this, internal versus external consistency.\nAnd external. I don't know if I spelled those right. I probably spelled them differently\nboth times. Yeah, did I? See? See? Yeah. That's one of those ones that I have set in my computer\nto autocorrect when I do it wrong. That's sort of the same thing. I've never had to\nlearn how to spell it right, because my computer just fixes it for me. Like, villain? That\nI and that A should not be in the order they actually are.\nRegardless, let's talk about internal versus external consistency. Or logic. I should just\nsay logic, because I can spell that. Internal logic, internal consistency, is usually\nreally important for most stories. Not for all stories. In fact, some humor stories make\na big deal out of their internal logic just being haywire, and that's a feature rather\nthan a bug. But for most of the time, when we talk about internal consistency, this is\nwhere the internal logic of your story fits and is consistent with itself. If this character\nputs on a magic ring and turns invisible, then you can extrapolate that this character\nwill later on put on the ring and turn invisible again. This is being consistent with your\nown rules and the rules that you give. This is generally really important for even\nsoft magics. Really important for hard magic, but even important for soft magic that you\ncan rely on a few things. It's consistent. Even if your soft magic is we're not sure\nwhat Gandalf can do, well then, you generally stay consistent of, we don't know what Gandalf\ncan do. Now you can move along that line. You can\nstart moving from soft to hard magic. In fact, almost every fantasy story slowly moves along\nthis line as you learn more and more what it can do. But you're just trying not to break\nyour own rules. Now people mistake this with external logic,\nor external consistency, where when you try to explain why the things are happening in\na way that makes sense to a person who understands physics and the laws of our universe.\nAn example of external logic, logic is much better, external logic is when they say X-Men\nhappened because they have the X gene. That is an attempt at external logic. They're saying,\nyou know how mutation works. If you watch some of the X-Men movies they're like, \"Sometimes\nmutations happen, and evolution happens rapidly.\" And they're trying to give it some external\nlogic to the story. Don't mistake those. Oftentimes I will mention\nin lectures that superhero magic systems tend to be very hard magic systems, particularly\nused modernly. People mistake that saying, \"Hard magic system? Superhero magic doesn't\nmake any sense.\" Well, yes, but Wolverine has a healing factor. He always has a healing\nfactor. This is what he does. It's consistent. It's hard magic. You understand what he can\ndo. That doesn't mean it has to make sense. Internal logic, it doesn't matter that Superman\ngets power from the sun somehow. But that's an attempt at external logic.\nTry to make sure you understand, like, why is this important. Well, some genres really\ndepend on your external logic working. This is hard science fiction, for an example. you\ndon't have to be 100% realistic, but you have to give people an ability to make the leap\nof logic. And in fact, a little bit of external logic, applied even to a fantasy book, can\nhelp people suspend their disbelief quite a bit.\nThis is why, in writing hard magic systems like I do, I usually add in a little bit of\nexternal logic. I usually say, all right, this is the characters discussing the laws\nof thermodynamics if you know physics, and then pointing out the hole, and this is how\nit works. Like, I give a little bit of that so the reader can suspend disbelief.\nSo how can you make a magic that doesn't feel like a magic? A lot of that's going to depend\non do you add a lot of external logic. Do you convince them that it's not a magic, that\nit's just the way things work? Or you can sometimes have a magic system that's built\ninto just the way, the logic of the universe. We don't necessarily question that in spy\nthrillers people can wear masks that make them look like other people. Well, sometimes\nwe do. But you know what I mean. You wouldn't call that a magic system really. But that\ntotally is of the spy genre. If you have a spy thriller where no one had had a mask up\nuntil the midpoint and then they pull it off, a lot of times in movies, the audience is\nlike, oh, yeah, that's part of spy thrillers.", "675": " I'm okay with them adding that, even though\nthey didn't set it up ahead of time in the way that Sanderson's First Law says they should,\nbecause the whole genre has some laws with", "681": " it.\nIf a person who is a vampire drinks someone's blood and gets their energy back at the end\nof a book where they've never done that before, most readers are going to be like, oh, yeah,\nthat's what vampires do. That's another way to kind of have a magic system that you are\nplaying off of, but that doesn't feel like magic, is if it's playing into the genre conventions\nin such a way that the general reader with fluency in that genre is going to expect it\nand not get tripped up by it. \"How do we give enough exposition to make\nthe reader understand the world, but maintain mystery and twists?\" That's a great question.\nLet me ask you, audience. How do you, in your own writing, or have you seen it in other\npeople's writing or stories, have you read books with a lot of science fiction and fantasy\nmystery to them, where the explanations don't remove that? How did that work for you? Yeah,\ngo ahead. STUDENT: I feel like this was achieved really\nwell in the first Mistborn book. BRANDON: OK. Well, thank you very much. Your\ncheck's in the mail. STUDENT: Not spoiling it for people, but at\nthe beginning of the book there's expectations and there's an explanation of certain aspects\nof the world and society that are lived in, so that the reader buys into it. Like, OK,\nthis is how it works. So a great twist is for them, the characters and the reader, to\nthen find out, \"Oh, no. We were lied to.\" BRANDON: The \"Oh, no. We were lied to,\" to\nthe readers is dangerous but very effective. A couple ways to do this is to-- the easiest\nway is to hang a lantern on it. This is a stage term. I don't know where it came from.\nIt's where you have a character specifically say, \"These two things don't look like they\ngo together. Oh, well, they obviously do.\" That's you saying to the reader, \"Hint, hint.\nSomething's wrong here.\" But a lot of times you can do it more subtly\nby showing two aspects of the magic or world that don't jive together, to the point that\nthey start to form a kind of clash, a dissonance where these things aren't in harmony. Then\nthe reader starts to subconsciously look for an explanation to stretch for why special\nrelativity and general relativity don't mesh yet, or something like that. Like, where's\nour unifying theory? And then when one pops up, the reader's like, \"Oh!.\" That's a way\nyou can build some mystery into it. But you can also, generally a good way to\nleave some mystery, is to say, \"Here is your one little segment of the world you're going\nto understand, Harry, but there's so many other things that people are doing. You're\njust at school. You're a first year. You're going to learn these three spells. But don't\nworry about all these other things that people are doing.\" And that kind of, like I said,\nJ. K. Rowling does a pretty decent job of balancing, in the Harry Potter books, this\nsense of wonder and a sense of internal logic. She does not maintain internal logic between\nbooks, which drives a lot of people crazy. That's where J. K. Rowling had-- When someone\nsays to you, \"Why didn't they use a time turner for this? Why don't they use a polyjuice potion\nfor this?\" Her internal logic per book tends to be really solid. You get this sense that\nyou're getting just enough explained that the characters can solve problems with the\nmagic, but you don't feel like all the mystery is gone. It just breaks apart a little bit\nbetween books. But I give those books that benefit of the doubt. I just say to myself,\nwell, the kids just don't understand why they can't use a polyjuice potion here, or why\ntime turners. They just didn't explain that to them because they're dumb kids, and things\nlike that. I allow myself that because J. K. Rowling\ndoes such a great job with internal logic of a given book, that in some ways it's too\nmuch to expect those books to also have the internal logic of Lord of the Rings, which\nhas really excellent internal logic. You just have to read a lot of The Silmarillion. It\nalso has great internal logic in the actual published books. Lord of the Rings is a gold\nstandard for how to use magic systems, like I talked about before.\nBut those are just a few ways. Anyone else have any ways that they have maintained mystery\nor seen it done? Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: I was just going to say, and this\nkind of tags along with what you were saying, kind of just a variation of it, but focus\non what the characters know. Focus on seeing things from their perspective, and that allows\nthe world to seem so much bigger, because it's around you.\nBRANDON: Yeah. This is the advantage of a third person limited. In case those online\ndidn't hear, he said focus on what the character knows and seeing the world through their eyes,\nand you can maintain a sense of grand scale and mystery, while still having them have\na little bit of control over their immediate situation. A third limited is just wonderful\nfor this. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: In the first Borne movie, Borne identity, it starts off with him on the island with\nthe doctor, and the doctor studies him and makes basically a list of Borne. Look at all\nthese things you can do, including having him just mentally [___]. So you know that\nhe has these capabilities, but you don't know where or how he got them.\nBRANDON: That's an excellent example. I'll repeat that. In the first Borne movie there's\na doctor who studies him and says, \"Here's all these cool abilities you have, but we\ndon't know where you got these different abilities.\" This actually answers the question before.\nThere's a great story that has a magic system that's not a magic system. Because the magic\nsystem is going to be Borne discovering his memories and why they get them back. If you\ndo it in a very logical way that someone says, \"Hey, if you do this you'll start getting\nyour memories back,\" that's a magic system. Fulfill this thing, do this thing, get this\nreward. And then the character starts to get his memories back and learn why he was able\nto do these things. At the end it ties very strongly into why he lost his memories, what\nhappened, and who he was before, all kind of converges on a single kind of character\narc and plot arc. It's a great example of a magic-less magic system.\nAll right let's go to next question here. \"Do you change or modify rules based on the\nage of the intended reader?\" I'll add to this one I know that's later in the list, which\nis \"Do you, while you're writing, ever change your rules?\" Let's talk about modifying rules.\nI think the person is asking, do I modify Sanderson's Laws, or do I modify how I use\nmagic systems when I'm writing for different age groups. Generally, I do not. There's this\nreally fine balance between writing down to an audience and writing specifically toward\nan audience. It is a tricky thing to navigate. Generally-- let's just put this on the board\nso you guys know where I'm coming from. Generally, in the publishing industry, children's books\nare 18 and under. So when we say children's fiction, it includes YA. That is a difficult\nthing for a lot of people to just get used to that terminology, because YA, not children.\nBut that is how the industry talks about children's books. When a publisher has a division between\nadult and children, children's is everything 18 and below.\nNow we have YA in here, which is covering about age 13 and up -ish. A rule of thumb:\nAge of your protagonist plus 2 is about the age group you're intending the book for. That's\nwhy you see a ton of 15- and 16-year-olds. People will generally read about someone older\nthan them, and they don't like reading about someone younger than them. Rule of thumb.\nThese are very loose rules. The Golden Compass is a great example of something just kind\nof breaking all of these rules and just ignoring them. They get shelved in three shelves in\nthe bookstore because no one knows where to put it.\nBut around 13, so this dividing line right here, there's a very big divide. Down here\nwe call it middle grade. There's a big dividing line right here that's different based on\nthe age of the reader, where the teen stops reading books that gatekeepers give them and\nstart picking up books that they have chosen. That's usually seen as the fuzzy line between\nmiddle grade and YA. That's why you just kind of think about--\nthe other kind of fuzzy line there is romance. Like, middle grade, it's like romance needs\nto be kind of puppy love-ish, and maybe a little hint here and there. They are curious\nabout it, but they don't really actually want a romance in their stories most of the time.\nOr if they do, it's a very kind of Disney romance. There's no actually romancing going\non. It's just the state of the world has become secure that these two have now formed a couple.\nWe know that that's supposed to happen. Those are kind of your two big things, and\nthat divides middle grade and YA. And then underneath it are, and there's some transitional\nbooks in here, but then we kind of go to the chapter book sort of thing. Then underneath\nthat, I am not an expert on, so I'll refer you to a different teacher to talk about the\nnuances between board books and picture books, and the easy-to-read books and things like\nthat. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: What about new adult? BRANDON: New adult has not become a thing.\nI'm glad you brought it up. There was an attempt at creating a new thing here that was like\n18 to 22 called new adult. This was just the children's publishers looking to have another\naudience. It has just not become a thing. You might be able to find people online who\ndisagree. But my experience has been, the last five or six years, publishers just stopped\nasking for new adult and stopped trying to make it a thing.\nAlready, the line between YA and adult was really getting vague, at the upper end YA.\nAS an example, Steelheart is shelved in YA in the US and in adult sci-fi/fantasy in the\nUK. That's the just publishers deciding, \"Ah, this is where we think it goes.\" You see that\nin a ton of upper YA. It's like, where is this line? Trying to put another line is there\nis generally, in my experience, not worked, but your mileage may vary. There may be publishers\nwho think it worked fantastically well. My publisher, when I asked them about new adult,\nthey're like, nah, just didn't become a thing. So good question.\nWhere I kind of reside is I haven't really written underneath middle grade. Middle grade,\nif you're wondering, Harry Potter is a good example. It starts in middle grade and then\nends in YA. Hunger Games is YA. Fablehaven is middle grade. Just kind of some touchstones\nthere for you. You do have kind of an important division\nright here. YA is not edited for content. Some editorial lines do edit for content.\nLike, if you're publishing with Disney, they are going to edit for content. But most editorial\nlines do not edit YA for content. That means they do not edit out swearing, sexuality,\nor violence. A lot of people have an impression that YA is edited for content. They mean middle\ngrade. Middle grade is edited for content by most publishers, which means that they\nwill try to get the middle grade to have less of an R rating, if you've written an R-rated\nmiddle grade for some reason. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: Do you ever have publishers or editors try to have you put more graphic content in?\nBRANDON: Okay, question. I get asked this a lot. Have I ever had editors or publishers\ntry to get me to put in more graphic violence or sex? No. This does not happen. It happens\nin romance, specifically, if you're writing erotica. They may come in and say, \"We need\nanother sex scene right here.\" That has definitely happened. You will occasionally get, if you're\nwriting an action thriller, be like, \"We need an action scene.\"\nBut this is a perception that people generally have outside the publishing industry about\nthe publishing industry, and that's just not the way the publishing industry works. They\npurchase a book from you because they like that style of book. The editor's job is going\nto be to make it a better version of that book. I've never had an editor even mention\nsaying, \"Oh, could we have more sex scenes?\" or things like that.\nI did have Moshe once ask me, he's my editor at TOR, he's like, \"Are Vin and Elend sleeping\ntogether?\" I said, \"Yes, but I have a large audience that doesn't want to imagine that\nthey are, so I just leave it off, leave it out.\" He's like, \"Oh, OK.\" Like, that's the\nclosest that we've ever gotten. Good question.\nMiddle grade will, my experience with middle grade, they will edit for content and they\nwill occasionally edit for word choice. Doesn't happen a lot, but sometimes they'll be like,\n\"This just doesn't feel like a middle grade word.\" You can use challenging words here\nand there, but if a passage just feels too much like they have to get out the dictionary\nto read it, I've had editors say, \"Can we use a more clear word here?\"\nFor middle grade, generally, my editors have been like, \"Let's streamline this. Let's focus\non one character. Let's keep the complexity down. And let's make sure that your magic\nsystem is simple and straightforward.\" That doesn't mean the situations can't get complex,\nor the emotions complex, and that's the difference I think. If you write down to your audience,\nyou are writing out the emotional complexity, and kind of the complexity that comes from\nthe difficulties of dealing with all of this stuff. That we don't want to do.\nIn middle grade, some editors will tell you, try to streamline and try to keep the world\nbuilding less complex and the learning curve much shallower. YA very rarely had that. Though\nthe number one editorial request I get from my YA editors is to ask me to give the reader\nmore emotional touchstones to what the characters are feeling. Where in adult I often have them\ngo the other direction and say, \"You're going overboard on the emotion. Just let the reader\npick it up.\" That's been the difference between my adult editors and my YA editors.\nSTUDENT: This is a kind of follow-up question. My central character is 8.\nBRANDON: Your central character is 8, yep. STUDENT: What are the dangers of that? Why\ndon't we see more adult books written with--? BRANDON: Yeah. Why don't we see more adult\nbooks written with child protagonists? Number one, they're hard to write, and number two,\nthe marketing people just don't know how to market them. But, I mean, Ender is 8 through\na big portion of Ender's Game. How old is he when he's in battle school? He's still\nnot that old, right? STUDENT: No, he's 11.\nBRANDON: Yeah, he's like 11. Ender's Game is a perfect example of a book that really\nis thematically YA, and you would call middle grade by age of the protagonist. But it's\nusually given to young adults. Young young adults, right? But it's usually read by people\nthat Ender is younger than them. This does happen. Most of the time you're\nsafest just saying it's an adult book, and if they decide to publish it somewhere else,\ngreat. The Golden Compass is another great example. His Dark Materials, where Lira, it's\nlike, how old is she in these? Is this a YA? Is it not? Nobody really knows.\nThis kind of speaks to, another tangent. This Q&A, we just go on tangents. Remember that\ngenre and all the things we talk about with genre, are marketing tools. This is why we\nhave science fiction and fantasy sections in a bookstore. It is a marketing tool. That\nmarketing tool can be very handy to people whose books naturally fit into one of these\ncategories. If your books don't naturally fit, it can be harder for you. That isn't\na reason to not write them, but it is a reason to try to do a little bit of the marketing\npeople's jobs for them by saying, \"This is an adult book with a child protagonist like\nX, Y, or Z.\" They'll be like, \"Oh, we know how to market X, Y, or Z. OK.\"\nThis is why, a lot of times, if you have-- it's really hard in romance because you have\nto ask the question, does your Charlaine Harris True Blood mystery with vampires go in fantasy,\nor in romance, or in mystery, or in horror? In the few places that still have horror sections\nof bookstores. Usually they will just use cover marketing and blurbs to solidify it\ninto one of those genres and place it there in the bookstore, even if it's a pretty bad\nfit sometimes, because it has to go somewhere. This is why you'll find Neal Stephenson in\nliterary fiction instead of science fiction a lot of times. They're like, \"We think the\nbest thing to do is market this toward that crowd that likes Margaret Atwood, who will\nlike some science fiction-y things, but are really looking for interesting prose as well.\nSo if we stick Neal Stephenson there, maybe they'll get it.\" But half the other time you'll\nfind Neal Stephenson in science fiction, because people are rightly saying, \"Hey, the father\nof modern cyberpunk probably belongs in science fiction.\"\nYeah? STUDENT: This is back to the internal/external\nlogic. BRANDON: Yeah.\nSTUDENT: What do you do if there's a case where they may conflict? How do you choose\nwhich one is better? BRANDON: Internal logic is almost always your\nbest choice, if they conflict. If they're conflicting, most of the time it's because\nyou are breaking some weird rule of external logic, some weird sort of--\nLet me give you an example here. This is going to be a weird example, but it will relate.\nI once read, I was reading a book, I think it was John Keegan's History of Warfare, where\nit talked about the theory that horses early in the classical era had not been bred to\nbe strong enough to carry a rider on their back, which was part of why chariots became\nsuch a big thing. I'm paraphrasing a very complicated anthropological discussion. But\nthis idea was, I loved the idea of, wait! Horses pulling something rather than having\nsomething sit on their back, you could have smaller horses and things like that.\nSo I wrote a book where you couldn't write the horses because it would break a horse's\nback. Every reader's like, \"These stupid people. How can they not have tried riding a horse?\nYou can obviously ride a horse. Why are entire cultures saying this stupid thing?\" It took\na lot of work to convince them that realistically people couldn't ride these horses because\nit would actually harm the horses. Readers had in their head that horses are something\nyou ride. Therefore, this rule breaks my external logic of this thing, even though it was actually\nexternally logical in the first place. That was something that taught me, if you're\ngoing to go against people's expectations, you need to put extra work into it. You generally\nwant to do this, because once you've done it, it gives you control over your story.\nI think that the internal logic is more important than the external logic, but you do have to\nrealize that sometimes you're going to have to be upfront with a little more of your world\nbuilding, which raises your learning curve. Basically your best choice is to find shows\nwhere you can show this working in the world, that will really imprint in people's brains.\nLike for instance, showing someone ride on a horse's back and it is hurting the horse.\nAnd then people remember, \"Oh, that's what happens,\" rather than just having people say\nit a lot. You run into this if you are using real world\nmythology. Because even though it doesn't have, real world mythology you have to pretend\nit has an external logic. People know what a vampire is. When we were talking earlier\nabout magic systems without magic systems, stuff like that. People are like, okay, vampires\nsuck blood. They are turned aside by garlic and crosses, yada, yada, yada. If you aren't\nhaving your vampires act like that, then the longer you go in your book without explaining\nhow your vampires work, the harder it is going to be to disabuse people of their expectations\nfor vampires, and indeed they're still going to forget, even after you've taught them,\nunless you're very careful about it. This is important to do because it's probably going\nto be plot relevant to you. But you have to realize there's just more\nwork to do in doing so, which is often why you see the fantasy books that'll use things\nthat are elves but aren't elves. They just have a different name. So it's like, these\naren't Tolkien elves. They're 95% Tolkien elves, but there's one thing that's very different,\nso we're just going to call them something else and try to reinforce to you what that\ndifference is. Yeah, let's go to the next question on the\nlist. All right. Spoiler questions about one of my books.\n\"Is there a way to see hard magic disguised as soft magic in a book?\"\nYeah, it's very, very common. Do realize that the readers interfacing with a story element\nis going to be the most important thing. If you've got a-- for instance, Anne McCaffrey.\nAnne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern, she insisted her entire life was science fiction\nand not fantasy. All right, you know. She added a bunch of external logic to explain\nhow the dragons worked and things like that. She worked very hard to explain this as science\nfiction. Everyone who read those books thought of them as fantasy.\nBecause the way the reader interfaces with the story is actually more important than\nwhat the author says about said story. I'm totally okay with Anne being like, \"No! These\nare science fiction.\" You can say whatever you want. You can tell people all you want\nabout your stories. But what they experience is way more important than any of that.\nIf you are having a hard magic disguised as a soft magic, you've got to treat your book\nlike a soft magic book, not like a hard-magic book. Though you can obviously make that transition\nover time, which is a very fun transition, as people find out the things that were illogical,\nthat seemed soft, get explanations and become hard magic.\nFred Saberhagen's Books of the Swords, which are very fun stories, it's been a long time\nsince I've read them, but what I believe happens in these books is a bunch of people from earth\nthat are very advanced with science fiction technology go to a planet where there are\nhumans and decide to be their gods. You only find out about these gods through secondhand\naccounts and things like this, as you slowly, through the series, realize, \"There's a reason\nwhy this mythology just sounds like our earth mythology, is the people who are these gods\nare just science fiction people who decide to go play god on a planet.\" Again, it's been\na long time, so I could be misquoting Fred's entire lore there.\nBut I've seen that sort of thing before, where it's like it's not magic, it's science, but\nthe people doing the science, it's-- Who's law is that? It's Clarke's Law? Any sufficiently\nadvanced science will seem like a magic to people who don't know about it.\nSo yes, you can definitely disguise a hard-magic system as a soft magic system. Just realize\nin most cases you need to treat that like a soft magic system because that's how the\nreader is going to experience it. \"How do you prevent world building from feeling\nlike a chore?\" Ooo, discovery writer here. Most of the time when people ask this, they\nare discovery writers. And I would recommend to you, write your book and don't stress it.\nFinish your book, and then decide what world building things you actually need to expand\nupon to tell the story that you have already told a little bit better. Do all of your world\nbuilding, for your first book at least, afterward. If you're feeling like world building's a\nchore, don't do it yet. Do what makes you excited to write your story.\nThen after you're story you'll get done and you'll be like, all right, I really need to\nunderstand these religions a little better. But most discovery writers will have filled\nin a lot of that as they're going, because they get excited by seeing through the character's\neyes and stuff. You can do a lot in post, so to speak, where you add all this stuff\nin. You only get into trouble when you are then doing more books in the series and you're\ngoing to have to stick to what you put in the first book.\nSo if you are a discovery writer, and that idea is very daunting to you, make sure you\nbuild in a bunch of mysteries that the characters don't understand yet, that you don't understand\nyet, that you can have fun exploring and extrapolating upon in the next book, so you have that same\nsense of eagerness, and then just make sure after you finish the book, you get some early\nreaders, find out what they're confused by, do your world building to fix that.\nUnderstand that, in general, any process that you use to arrive at a published book, readers\ngenerally, if you're doing your job right, won't be able to tell what your process was.\nIn fact, I had a really interesting conversation with Cory Doctorow once where he said, \"It's\nreally interesting that readers generally can't tell which chapters took me six months\nof sweat, blood, and tears, and which chapters I wrote in an afternoon and they were great\non the first try.\" That's because the process of publishing and revision is built around\nthis idea that by the end you're hopefully having a consistent quality, and the things\nthat are really hard, or that come out really rough in your first drafts get smoothed over\nuntil the point that it is a finished piece of art.\nIf you're a discovery writer, or if you're some weird hybrid between, which really most\nof us are, don't stress about this. Do what makes you excited to write the book. Finish\nthe book and then ask yourself, all right, what does this really need in revision to\nmake it better? STUDENT: How do you do this if you're a hard\noutliner. Say that you have a plot and character, but you're like, well setting and details,\nand do I really want to explain how this works, kind of thing?\nBRANDON: The thing about it is, you can hybridize these things really easily. Try to pretend\nthat it's not, like, one camp or the other. I bet there are a ton of people out there\nwho come up with a pretty solid plot and characters and don't world build at all until they're\ndone with the book. At that point you kind of have to make a few decisions based on what\ndo you want the feel of your book to be? How much world building and lore do you want there\nto be? How much of this is a selling point for your book?\nThere are lots of great books that don't spend very much time on the lore world building\naspect. A lot of these are kind of your David Gemmell-type gritty, or the kind of modern\nwave of the Joe Abercrombie-style books, where it's like, who cares about the thousand years\nof history and lore, or this thing. I'm telling a story about this one person going and doing\nthis one interesting thing. In that case, you can just say, this isn't a selling point\nof my books. My selling point is something else. I'm just not going to do it. I'm not\ngoing to worry about it. That's okay. In fact, that's advised. Do what is exciting to you.\nNow, give your book to readers. See what readers are wanting more of, and you don't always\nwant to give it to them, but you can acknowledge, OK, they're confused here. We need a little\nbit more here or things like that and use the tools to write the story you want to write.\nBut just like in visual arts, not every piece of artwork needs to be an incredibly realistic,\ndetailed oil painting. There are people who do with three brush strokes things that feel\namazing, with very little amounts of detail put into that painting. It's hard to say,\nyou can say which one you like more, but I don't know if one is more art than another,\nif that makes sense. Create the type of art you want to create,\nand if world building is like pulling teeth for you, then write books where you don't\nneed it, and only put in as much as you feel like you need. For the rest of you who are\nlike me, just don't let it overcome the story, and don't let yourself spend too much time\nworld building. Otherwise you'll never write your stories.\nWhat's my opinion on fan fiction?", "2437": " A little off topic, but I think fan fiction\nis cool. I'm glad people write fan fiction. I didn't come up through that community. I\nnever really read a lot of fan fiction. I don't read the fan fiction based on my books.\nBut I think it's an important and valid part of the writing community. Once in a while\nyou can shave the serial numbers off your fan fiction and sell 40 million copies, or\nwhatever. If you don't know, 50 Shades of Gray was a\nfan fiction. You didn't know that? Oh, it was a Twilight fan fic. Yeah. It was. Very,\nvery explicitly. It was posted online. And then she changed it around to not be a Twilight\nfan fic and sold a lot of books. Lot of books. All right. \"How do you know if your magic\nsystem works?\" How do you know if your magic system works?\nAll right. We have to define \"works.\" Because like every other part of writing, a magic\nsystem is a tool to help you achieve your goals, and you have to decide what your goals\nare. That is different for every writer. What do you want it to do?\nThis kind of comes into some Brandon Sanderson philosophy on art. I feel like sometimes,\njust in writing and all sorts of-- writing in specific, we have this sort of pretentious\nfeel that is very different from other types of art. I'll often align this to visual mediums,\nor even food. If you don't like fish, then that's OK. Nothing wrong. Now once in a while,\neven in food, people will die on certain hills about how you cook a steak. It does happen.\nBut a lot of times someone says, \"You know what? I prefer this flavor of ice cream to\nthis flavor of ice cream.\" And everyone's like, \"Oh, that's too bad you don't like the\nthing I like, but I can understand everyone has different tastes.\"\nIn fiction we put a lot more behind it. Some of this is valid, and some of it I'm like,\nI don't know if one art is necessarily better than another art. But it comes- you have to\njudge which is better art and which isn't. That's kind of what we do all the time. It's\npart of being a human being. It's not like we shouldn't do it, but as the\nsame time, as you as an artist, when you are creating a piece of art and a piece of writing,\nyour focus should be on what do I want this piece of art to achieve? What is my goal with\nit? I'm going to measure your success in creating that art based on how well you were able to\ndo the thing you were trying to do. Once you do that, then there's other levels of certain\ntypes of art, whatever, and things like that. But at its core, the first thing you should\nbe looking to do is, what do I want my art to do? In that case, use the magic system\nto achieve what you want it to do.", "2638": " How do you know? You find your audience, somehow,\nwho are people that you are writing this book for. May just be your family. It might be\nyou wanting to go full time and are looking for a large segment of the fantasy-reading\npublic, or the science fiction-reading public, or whatever. You give the book to them and\njudge their reactions. This is why it's better for readers to say their emotional response\nto things, rather than trying to fix it. Because sometimes you will have a book that\nyou planned a character to be the funniest character ever put to the page. Then the character\nturns out to be Jar Jar Binks, and your audience hates this character. You have done something\nwrong in that case. But sometimes you are writing a character that you just want to\nmake a certain segment of the population very uncomfortable, and another segment of the\npopulation to laugh a lot, Mr. Bean. Some people detest Mr. Bean, and some people laugh\nuproariously at Mr. Bean. That is not wrong because half the audience\nhates it. I wouldn't say half. But a segment of the population hates it. It is targeting\nthe right audience, and you find out what that audience is and see if you're-- there's\na very big difference between Mr. Bean and Jar Jar Binks, where one was intended to do\nsomething and didn't do it, and the other one did exactly what it's intended to do.\nIs the magic system working? What is it intended to do in your story, for the audience you\nare trying to reach? Do some experiments with this, and then use the magic system as a tool\nto help you achieve the type of art that you want to achieve. Easier said than done, I\ndo acknowledge that. Let's see. Let's see. \"I'd love to screen\nwrite for animation. Any tips?\" No. Well, one. Go to a screenwriting class.\nI am, unfortunately, not an expert in screenwriting. I have written one and a half screenplays.\nMaybe someday I will become more of an expert at screenwriting, but I am very much not an\nexpert in a screenwriting career. Now that's the thing. I am only barely an expert in how\nto break into sci-fi/fantasy publishing. Why? Because I broke in 15 years ago. Anyone who\nbroke in 15 years ago is going to have a very different experience from people breaking\nin today. And in fact, the further I get from when I broke in, the more difficult it is\nfor me to be an expert on how you break in right now. That's something you should always\nkeep in mind when you're getting advice, specifically on breaking in, because the market and the\nway people break in changes a lot. When I was trying to break in, there were\na lot of people who were like, \"You need to write short stories.\" These were the old guard,\nwho all broke in in the '60s and '70s by writing short fiction for the magazines. I was trying\nto break in in the '90s and the 2000s, and guess what? The magazine market had dried\nup. There were much fewer magazines in circulation. They paid a lot less.\nAnd beyond that, the people who were really good at short stories were really good at\nshort stories. As we proved last week, this is not something I'm really good at. I could\nbecome good at it, but I read novels. I wrote novels. I enjoyed novels. And so the advice\nof break in with short stories was terrible advice for me. In fact, I think it was terrible\nadvice for the majority of people trying to break in in my era, because they didn't subscribe\nto the magazines, they weren't reading the short stories, so they didn't know how to\nwrite them. In the same way, I can't give you advice on\nbreaking into screen writing or animation. You've got to go to somebody who's done it\nrecently. I can tell you, this person asked, \"Is editing\nfantasy/sci-fi a good backup plan?\"", "2882": " OK, let's talk about becoming an editor. OK?\nThe answer is no*. All right? The reason that planning on becoming an editor as a backup\nfor becoming a published author is that there are fewer editing jobs than there are jobs\nfor professional writers. Now, the editing jobs are a little easier to get than breaking\nout big as a sci-fi/fantasy writer. But there are way fewer of them. So if you have a dual\ninterest and you like them both, it's totally valid to pursue both at the same time, just\nlike if you read a lot of short stories and novels it'd be perfectly valid for you to\ntry to break in on either direction. But if you're like, \"Hmm, I'll just become\nan editor as a failsafe,\" it is really hard to become an editor of sci-fi/fantasy. There\nare, in Utah there's like two jobs for sci-fi/fantasy editors, and I don't think Lisa Mangum is\ngoing to quit any time soon, and I don't think Chris Schoebinger is going to quit any time\nsoon. So guess what? There are no jobs. I could be exaggerating. They might have an\nintern or assistant at Shadow Mountain who cycles through.\nBut if you want to be a trade science fiction/fantasy editor, you are going to need to move to New\nYork. That is where 95% of the jobs are. The little percents that are not in New York are\nin Seattle at Wizards of the Coast, or in Boston at Houghton Mifflin, and that's about\nit. Unless you're talking about Europe and going to London, which, yeah.\nSo you're going to have to live in New York. OK? You're just going to have to be dedicated\nto moving to New York, which is extremely expensive. You're going to be competing against\npeople for jobs who have master's degrees in editor from Columbia, who live in New York\nand are applying to all the internships, because they have editing programs at NYU and at Columbia,\nright in New York, and those are who you're competing against.\nIt not impossible. One person from my era at BYU, Stacy Whitman, managed to break into\nchildren's trade as an editor. She went and got a master's degree at a prestigious university\nin Boston, made a lot of contacts in New York and Boston, managed to get a job at Wizards\nof the Coast, and then moved to starting her own imprint at a children's publisher in New\nYork. It is totally possible. She's the only one who did that from my age group, and I've\ngot-- there's, like, seven of us who went full time as writers. I guess you can count\nPeter, my editorial assistant. He took the Manga route and went and got a job at Tokyopop,\nand then I hired him away here. But it is just really hard, OK, really hard.\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't do it if you're really excited by it. But don't use it as\nyour failsafe, the \"of course, I can just become an editor.\" It's really tough. If you\nwant to do it, you're going to need to start talking to editors about how to do it, how\nto get into the programs, how to get the internships. And good luck to you, because people do do\nit. Ann Swords from BYU, who was the generation before me, is a senior editor at Ace. So there's\nat least one person from BYU who went on to become a professional science fiction/fantasy\neditor at a major big five house in New York. She's the only one, I think, who did that.\nSo it's possible. Someone from this class, Ben Grange, became\nan agent. Becoming an agent, little bit easier. There's a few more jobs, I would say, as agents.\nBut also it's very demanding, because you make money based on your authors, and if you\nhave a bad eye for picking authors, you just won't make any money. But we'll talk about\nagents later. Did that make sense to you guys? Any other\nquestions on that? BYU does have a decent editing program. You can go into that and\nsee if you like it. And do know there are lots more jobs if you are willing to not edit\nsci-fi/fantasy. If you're willing to edit trade manuals for hearing aid companies, there's\na lot of jobs. \"How can you make limits or weaknesses appear\nnatural and not contrived?\"", "3158": " Ooo, boy, contrived. Here's the thing. Everything\nin a book is contrived. Everything in our lives in real life is coincidental. Coincidence\nis basically how everything works. Every story is a set of coincidences. This, on one hand,\nis not a problem, because having a character win $10 million in the lottery is no less\nor more likely than any person just winning $10 million in the lottery in real life. It\ndoes happen. However, there's this sense that if you make\nthings too easy or convenient for the reader, then the reader sees the author's hand. You\nwant to give an illusion that it's not coincidental, even though it absolutely is coincidental\nand contrived in every situation. So this is a good question, asking yourself how do\nyou make the weaknesses and limitations not seem contrived.\nUsually, we do these with some measure of internal or external logic. Superman's powers\nare taken away by a magic rock. Saying that", "3235": " alone is like, eh, that seems really contrived.\nOh, it's a magic rock from his home world. And when he lived on it he didn't have powers,\nso when you're near it he doesn't have powers. Oh, that seems less contrived. It's exactly\nas much contrived, but it gives a sense that it's not. That is usually one of the worst\nexamples of magic rock takes away super being's powers for reasons.\nYou can come up with better reasons. For instance, limitation on the One Ring, Sauron can see\nyou. Why? Sauron built the rings to be able to do this. Every reader accepts that, because\nit's inside. It's internal logic. You've given it a reason and inched toward external logic\nby saying why would somebody do this? Why would somebody create this? Oh, a reasonable\nperson might, themselves, do this. Therefore the limitation, the flaw, makes sense. If\nyou're doing this with a magic system, just try to juggle your consistency, your logic,\nin such a way that it makes a certain amount of sense in the book.\nIn fact, someone asked me, \"How do you tie", "3307": " disparate magic systems together into a given\nnovel?\" It's another question later on. And I say, use these things also. I developed\nallomancy and feruchemy as separate magic systems for two different books. Feruchemy\ncame because I remember being in high school and being an insomniac, and this was not a\ngood match for high school. I was tired all day and then tried to go to sleep at night\nand just lay in bed. I thought, \"I wish I could store up my sleepiness in some sort\nof amulet, and then take it out when I want to go to bed. And then when I don't want to\nbe asleep, I can just put my sleepiness in this thing and be awake.\" Wouldn't that be\nwonderful? That'd be pretty great. That was the foundation for what became the\nmagic system called feruchemy in the Mistborn books. When I added that into the books, I\nsaid, \"This is going to feel really weird adding this magic system to this one where\npeople jump around on bits of metal and eat it. How do I make it consistent? Oh, we're\njust going to make it, metal be a theme. You use metal to put-- you can't just have anything.\nYou've got a piece of metal. We'll make the different metals do different things in one\nmagic and do analogous things in the other magic.\" And so suddenly it feels like they're\ncohesively one magic system, even though they were developed completely separately and don't\nreally, on paper, feel like they should have anything to do with one another.\nThis is actually really easy to do when you're building your magic systems. Come up with\na theme, ask yourself about this theme, and play with it for a little while. See what\nends up working with readers, and get them to buy in. It's not as hard as it sounds,\nbut it does take a little practice. All right. \"What does Brandon think of The\nMandalorian?\" Continuing our theme of Star", "3417": " Wars stuff.\nI liked The Mandalorian. I really enjoyed it. It was just fun. I liked the beginning\nepisodes and the end episodes better. You can probably tell that from the type of books\nI write. I like a consistent story and a long-reaching arc, rather than the mini episodes in the\nmiddle. But the heist mini episode in the middle was really great, so some of those\nwere good too. So thumbs up, good job, John Favreau and friends.\nThey had, like, a ton of-- it felt like-- do you guys watch that, watch the different\ndirectors when they pop up, and you'll be like, \"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Hey!\"\nIt's just like, \"I know you've been in a Marvel movie, and you were buddies over here.\" It\nfelt like a bunch of friends got together and were like, \"We're going to make a Star\nWars show,\" and they just did. How do you say his name? The director of Thor:\nRagnarok? STUDENT: Taika Waititi.\nBRANDON: Taika Waititi? He was the voice of the droid in the finale. He directed the finale\nand he was the voice of the droid and stuff like that. I'm like, \"You guys are just having\na party. You're just spending Lucasfilm\u2019s' money to have a party.\" And I'm totally behind\nthis. It feels like Star Wars hasn't been enough fun for a while, and that felt like\njust a lot of fun. All right let's see. \"How do you decide that\nyou need to add some new magic, and how do you add it smoothly without turning it into\na deus ex machina?\" That's an excellent question, very good question,\nbecause Sanderson's First Law came out from me messing this up. There's another question\nlater on that was like, \"Are Sanderson's Laws absolute?\" I guess I didn't make this clear\nenough. No. No, no, no. The whole theme of this class is, nothing is absolute, and I\nam going to be wrong some amount of the time. Sanderson's Laws have worked very well for\nme, in order to help me create the types of magic systems I like to create in books, and\nI think they have interesting applications to storytelling in general that are worth\ndoing an entire class period on so that hopefully this helps people. But I am sure there are\nfantastic magic systems out there that just completely ignore any sort of Sanderson's\nLaws, as well they should, because that's that creator's vision. Doesn't have to be\nmine. But how to, in my way, add a new magic system\nelement without making it feel out of nowhere? Well, number one, you make sure, if you're\nworried that you're going to be doing this, that this will happen, that when you're writing\nyour story you indicate that there are holes in the magic. This is really handy, particularly\nif you're going to be writing in a series and you don't know exactly what you're going\nto be doing in your series, saying, \"You know what? We don't understand this aspect of it.\nIt's something else.\" Example of this in Mistborn is when I have\nSazed use his magic, feruchemy, I have him use it mostly offscreen, and I have him use\nit in a moment that is kind of a violation of Sanderson's First Law. if you haven't read\nthe book, Vin is unable to escape something that is happening, and rather than suffer\nthe consequences, Sazed steps in and saves her.\nNow, this works on a couple of levels as a reason. Back then I didn't even really know\nSanderson's First Law. But even still, I would still have done this sequence the same way.\nOne reason is, it's in the middle of the book. The purpose is not to give you a satisfying\nresolution to Vin using her magic. Vin is new at the magic, and it's mostly Kelsior's\nfault that she's in this trouble in that scene anyway. She does not deserve to pay the price\nfor Kelsior's foolhardiness in this situation. And so I don't feel like it's pulling back,\npulling punches, by having someone else, who's her other surrogate father figure in the series,\nshow up and save her when Kelsior's abilities fail.\nBeyond that, mostly this is here as an introduction to Sazed having powers that we don't understand\nthat are going to be relevant later in this book and very relevant in future books. So\nhaving this moment to introduce that idea was more important to me than making Vin get\nout of this specific situation on her own, because it was well beyond her ability to\nget out of anyway. So in that situation, this whole sequence, which is violating Sanderson's\nFirst Law, but not really because I added in the \"satisfying.\" \"It's not satisfying\"\ngives me a catch-all for violating my own rules. But it does something else. What it\ndoes is say, hey, there's mystery to this other magic system that we're going to explore\nlater. That is a really great way to do this. But another great way is to foreshadow things\ngoing wrong. How many times have you-- like they do this all the time in superhero comics,\nwhere it's like characters starting to manifest new power. We have them start to do it early\non. I mean, they just did it in the new Star Wars movie. They knew they needed to have\na certain character perform a certain feat with the Force later in the movie that had\nnot ever been used in the Force in the movies before. So they put in a wounded snake.\nWhat's that? STUDENT: It did in The Mandalorian.\nBRANDON: It did in The Mandalorian, but The Mandalorian was made after this movie. It\nalso existed in the video games and stuff, but it hadn't been in the movie cannon. So\nthey were like, \"We're going to put it into the movie cannon early in the movie, so later\non when we need this special Force power, it has been used a couple of times.\" You put\nthis in early, then use it later. In fact, you can always do that in post.\nIn fact, there's a piece of me that believes, I haven't asked this, but there's a piece\nof me that believed that they got the whole movie done and they're like, \"You know, this\nwhole Force power comes out of nowhere. We should really add a scene where someone uses\nit early on and discovers how to use it.\" And they're like, \"Yeah, giant snake.\" And\nBaby Yoda. But you can't have television continuity. That's a separate-- they are the same continuity,\nbut it's a separate viewer experience. Your viewer experience should not have to depend\non a different viewer experience. Regardless, it happens all the time in comic\nbooks where the characters, like, they're trying to shoot their web slinger, but it\ndoes something weird, and they're like, \"Why is this not doing this like it's supposed\nto? Something's going on.\" Then later on it becomes a plot point, and then they figure\nit out, and then they use it to solve the problem. If you don't want to violate Sanderson's\nFirst Law, really all its saying is do your groundwork ahead of time, or in post.\nI actually write sometimes; you guys will love this. Any Bill and Ted fans in here?\nIf I ever run into something where I've added in something that I know I should have foreshadowed,\nbut I don't want to go do it right now, I put in brackets \"remember a bucket.\" Because\nthere's a scene in Bill and Ted where they're captured and they're like, \"We've got to remember\nto go back in time and put a bucket right up there.\" Then the bucket falls, and they're\nlike, \"Yeah!\" I just tell myself to remember the bucket, and then when I'm doing revisions\nI'll go back, and I'll add in the bucket. All right let's talk briefly, for 10 minutes,\nabout revision, just to kind of do something a little different this week as well.\nRevision. Boy, I hate revision. I just loathe", "3898": " it. I know there are people in here who love\nit. I have friends who love it, because they're like, \"Revision is so much easier than coming\nup with the new stuff. Now I have something to work with.\" Which I can understand.\nWriting a book is a little bit more like making a sculpture than non-writers might think,\nwhere it's like, the person who's making a sculpture is like, \"First I get the general\nsense of the shape of the face, and then I work a little bit here.\" And each pass you\ndo over it makes it look a little bit more like a face.\nWell, books are the same way. A lot of times, revision-- the job for me in my first drafts\nis to get down the main plot arcs, the character's emotional beats, and just to make sure that\nthe book has a satisfying set of promises and payoffs. And so I am not looking for anything\nrelated to the prose. But also my foreshadowing, like remember a bucket, I'll just write something.\nA lot of times, if I'm writing a book, it's more important for me to keep momentum than\nit is anything else. So if I change something, I'll just change it for the next chapter.\nThen if it works, I'll pretend it had always been there. But revision is this process by\nwhich we refine a book and make it better. Now, I need to play devil's advocate for a\nsecond and mention that there is a group of-- there's a writing philosophy and a group of\nwriters subscribe to this, who think you should not revise. This philosophy goes something\nlike this. I'm hoping to not misquote it. I want to give the argument the best that\nthey would, which is, you're better off practicing your writing skills and trusting your instincts.\nYou're better off learning to do things in first draft, rather than making excuses for\nyourself to fix later. And most of the time, these people say, when you revise you're not\nactually making it better, you're just making it different, and so you shouldn't revise\nunless an editor says you have to do this revision, or I won't buy it. This is a philosophy\nbased off of-- those are Heinlein's rules. I don't know how strictly he kept to them.\nBut there is a large group, not a large group, there is a small but vocal group of writers\nwho believe that you should never revise. You can Google about this and find this.\nI have not found this to be true in my writing. Your mileage may vary. I have found that revision\nis a vital part of taking something good and making it great. This is partially because,\nas I think I told you in a previous week, I can't keep everything in my head at once.\nI'm doing a Stormlight book right now. If you haven't read the Stormlight books-- I\nthink I told you guys this. I don't know. If you haven't read them, there's things called\nSpren, which are attracted to people's emotions. It's almost like these sprite things that'll\nappear. If you're really angry, they'll appear in the form of pools of blood at your feet.\nVisual manifestations of emotions are a theme in the Stormlight books. I don't put those\nin in the first draft. Too much to keep in my mind.\nI actually have an assistant read through and find any time I mention emotion, and then\nbracket what type of emotion Spren they think would be drawn by that thing, and then I will,\nin a later draft, it's like adding special effects to a movie, I will go through and\nadd them all in. This is because keeping-- I am so focused on character arcs and making\nsure the plot works in my first drafts, that I am not thinking about any of this.\nWhat I do for a revision, then, is 1.0, is straight through. My 1.0 draft is I go beginning\nto end. Then after I finish my 1.0, I build a revision guide. This is like an outline\nfor a revision. I go through the book, and I've just finished it, and I'm usually taking\nnotes as I write of things that I want to fix, and in the 2.0 I'm going to be looking\nfor major plot problems or major character arc problems. Because that was what my main\ngoal was in my 1.0, and there will be things I get wrong. There will be things I change.\nThere will be things that just aren't working that I know I need to pull out and fix.\nThe 2.0 is to just get that down for me, and I will do it by making a hierarchical list\nof what is most important at the top, all the way down to little things I want to change\nhere or there or include. The middle section will often say things like, \"foreshadow that\nthis character is really good at getting out of handcuffs three times.\" I'll just give\nmyself a rule, three times. and those are kind of the middle section, anything I can\ndo with a spot fix a couple of times. Anything in the bottom section is things that are specific\nto one chapter that are a little tweak. And anything on the top, there's just too many\nchanges to make to check them off. Like, it's pervasive through the entire book.\nSomething in the 1.0 section might be along the lines of when I told you about Oathbringer\nwhere it's like, I didn't know it at this revision, but it's like this whole plot cycle\nhas the wrong promise at the beginning and is pointing readers toward the wrong thing.\nI need to do a major revision of this entire plot cycle, so the promise is working. That\nsort of thing, and I am just aligning these. And then when I do my revision, I start on\npage 1, and I have my revision guide open next to the document on the screen, and I\njust go through, looking to keep my focus on the things I've put on here. I will actually\nstart adding things to the bottom for a next revision, if there are things I notice I need\nto do for another revision. But this one is only these things on this list. I can only\ndo a certain number of things with each revision. So let's make a targeted list. The 2.0 is\nall the stuff that I know how to fix. At that point, I give the book, ideally, to\nalpha readers. Alpha readers are going to come back, and I'm going to make a revision\nguide based on the things they say. Sometimes this will be stuff from my editor that'll\nsay, \"I really think such-and-such thing.\" I'll be like, \"All right. I'm going to try\nthat in a chapter and see if it works.\" One chapter, and if I like how it is better I'll\nkeep going, and if not, then I'll tell them, \"I don't think this is the solution.\" Or several\nchapters. But alpha read makes another revision document.\nI add to the bottom of it anything I didn't get in the first revision, because my focus\nwas on those top things. I sometimes won't get to the middle or bottom. I will add those\non and their own middle or bottom. I will add on new things that I came up with. Then\nit kind of becomes like I am bug fixing while I'm going through.\nAfter that we have a 3.0 that is the beta reads. Again, for me, alpha readers are business\ninsiders who can tell me if something is wrong and how to fix it. Beta readers are generally\ngoing to be casual readers or super fans who are readers, those two. But the idea is that\nthey are not industry professionals. They are my audience. How is my audience responding\nto the thing I did? I want to know, in my beta read, if Jar Jar Binks is driving every\ncharacter up the wall. And I might decide, \"You know what? I'm really to keep Jar Jar\nBinks for the 10% that he doesn't drive up the wall.\" I might decide, \"Oh, wow. I have\nmade a major miscalculation in this character. I need to do something.\" I'm just looking\nfor their reactions. Personally, this is to prepare me for how\nreaders will react to my book when I release it. If I get a good cross section of my readership\nin beta reads, I will never release a book and be surprised by the reaction to it. I\nwill then do a 4.0 that is changing things based on what I think will better target my\naudience, based on the reactions. Lucas famously had the Millennium Falcon get blown up at\nthe end of Return of the Jedi, showed it to test audiences, and they hated it. I don't\nknow what happened with Jar Jar. But then this one he showed, and he's like, \"Huh, let's\nnot blow up the Millennium Falcon.\" And you know what? There was much rejoicing because\neveryone was happy. Then my 5.0 is my polish. Now, I've been polishing\nall the way through this. boy, you can barely read that. Polish, yeah. I've been polishing\nall the way through this. Every draft I'm doing some. But this is my last one where\nI'm going to cut 10% of the book. I'm going to try and kill every instance of passive\nvoice that I can. I'm going to try to make things active instead of passive. I'm going\nto try to use stronger verbs instead of weaker verbs. All the stuff that makes a book more\nreadable, that's my 5.0. And 5.0 is generally the one that I send to copy edit and proofread.\nIf you have one takeaway from here, it's if revision is something that you hate, try to\nmake a plan for how you're going to achieve a revision on your book.\nOne danger people do get into that I'll take from this crowd over here, that we'll kind\nof end on is, I have had people who have revised the same chapter 20 times. They go to writing\ngroup. They go to workshops. They bring the same chapter, and each time they try to revise\nit to whatever everyone said. At that point, the chapter's not getting better. It is just\nchanging. It's becoming something different. Don't let your revision become that, from\nthis crowd that say don't revise. But do try to make it goal-based and try to learn something\nnew with each revision. We'll see you guys next week. We'll talk about\ncharacter."}, "9": {"0": " BRANDON: All right, guys. Hey! Woo hoo. It's\ntime for class, woo hoo! Today we're going to talk about characters.\nCLASS: Yay! BRANDON: Yay! It's kind of interesting, because\na lot of times when I do this class I start with character. But I just kind of play it\nby ear each time. We're going to do two weeks on character.\nWe're going to start today with me kind of talking about what the purpose of characters\nare-- is. Which kind of sounds a little silly. We all know what the purpose of characters\nis. They're the people who do the stuff in the stories. But characters fulfill different\nroles, and the way that you use your main characters, in particular, is going to form\na lot of the shape of your story and your plot. Today we're going to kind of just talk\nabout this idea of characters as elements in your story, and how do you do things like\nmake your reader care about them. When I was an undergraduate studying creative\nwriting, this is one of those things that I kept asking and never got answers on in\na lot of my classes. A lot of my classes, I'd say, all right, that's great, telling\nme about searching for my soul in my writing. Wonderful. Want to do that. How do I make\npeople like my characters? How do I make people care about reading my story? Because a lot\nof the stories I'm reading by myself and the other students, I don't care. How do we make\npeople care? As I've thought about this and how to kind\nof talk about it, I've divided it into kind of three ideas of how we make people care\nabout our characters. This kind of gets down to the core reason you're using a main character\nin the first place. Like, you theoretically could tell a story without characters. There\nare some writers, who I will not name, who seem like they would much prefer to be able\nto write like that. I'm not naming names. We're not naming names.\nThe first thing that I think a character does for you, and one of the ways you make people\ncare, is you establish empathy. If you want the reader to care about your story, one of\nthe ways you do it is this. Now, this is really, really important, because I think that a lot\nof people who write science fiction and fantasy come to it from a world building background,\nand you spend a lot of time on your world building. You think about how cool it would\nbe if X, Y, or Z happened. You come up with a creative and innovative magic system and\nall of these things. But a magic system is only as interesting\nas the people using it. An action sequence is generally going to be meaningless if you\ndon't care who lives and who dies. Not always. There are some that the spectacle of the action\nscene itself is what propels you through it. But in general in a story, if you don't care\nwho lives and dies, that action sequence loses a lot of its power for you.\nThe setting is generally only as interesting in that it causes problems or an interesting\nplace for your characters to travel. Creating characters that we care about, so\nthat all of these other pieces mean something, is really important, and one of the most important\nthings that you want to learn how to do in your writing.\nNow, character is one of these things that for me, I had a lot more trouble talking about\ncharacter when I started teaching. And even still, the pieces of what makes a character\nwork are a little more ephemeral for me. I, as a writer, I've told you before, I generally\noutline my setting and my plot ahead of time, and my characters I cast, meaning I say, all\nright, I'm going to try writing a character in this world. I'm going to see where this\nperson goes, what their passions, and dreams, and hopes, and fears are as I write them,\nand if that works, great. I'm going to keep going with that, and that becomes my character.\nIf that doesn't I put that aside and I try something very different. Over the year, I've\ngotten so that I do this less and less. But I still, like for instance, my two big series,\nMistborn and Stormlight, both basically started with me trying different characters, and then\nputting them aside and trying new characters, until I arrived upon the ones that worked.\nWe'll talk a little bit later about what made me decide they worked, as opposed to other\nones. But in your story, as you're starting off,\none of the first things you want to try to do is establish empathy. This kind of gets\ninto the things I'll talk about a little later. You might have heard me talk about them in\nprevious years, where I have these sliding scales, where I talk about what makes readers\ninterested in a character. One of them, of these sliding scales, that correlates to establish\nempathy, is likeability.", "325": " We establish empathy for a character through\na couple of different methods, one of which is, we show that they are like us in some\nway. Showing that a character is relatable immediately establishes empathy. Another way\nthat we do it is we make them nice. Now your definition of nice may vary, but\nwe're kind of talking about this idea of, there's a famous screenwriting book called\nSave the Cat. The title of Save the Cat, where it comes from, is this old idea in Hollywood\nthat if you want someone to like a hero, you have them save a cat, and if you want someone\nto hate a villain, you have them kick a dog. The idea being that if someone is likeable,\nif they have normal human sympathies and things like this, then it will establish empathy.\nThis is why so often when a writer makes a villain, and they're very villainous, but\nyou want to humanize them a little bit, you will show them doing something like us, show\nthem being-- they are this monstrous tyrant who wants to destroy half of the universe.\nBut they still love their family in their own twisted way. That is like us. That's a\nnormal, relatable, human sort of thing, or giant purple monster sort of thing.\nLet's see. There's one more I have in here. Another thing that you can do to establish\nempathy is show people liking them. This is really handy. We will instantly like someone\nwho is liked by other people. This is how it works. This is showing a character having\na family, or showing a character having friends. We immediately say, well, somebody likes them,\nmaybe I will as well. So establish empathy. I want to make it clear as I go through these\nthings, you do not have to do each of these things for every character. These are just\nways to get us emotionally invested in your story using character. Number one, establish\nempathy. Number two is-- let me get this wording right,\nestablish rooting interest. What I mean by establishing rooting interest is that you\nare going to show that what the character wants is interesting to us. This is basically\ngiving the character a motivation. You're going to show us what the character wants.\nCharacters who want things are naturally more interesting to us than characters who don't.\nThis is why Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is so interesting, because it has a protagonist\nwho doesn't want anything, really, other than maybe a nice cup of tea.\nWhat's that? STUDENT: British.\nBRANDON: Yeah, British. But the story is doing that intentionally to be a farce by showing\nhere is a protagonist who refuses to protag. Establish your rooting interesting. You want\nto have a character want something, even if it is just a cup of tea. You want a character\nwho wants something out of life that they generally can't have. That's another thing\nis, what do they want? Why can't they have it? This is going to kind of spiral into their\nflaws, or their handicaps, or their limitations. Why can't the character have this thing that\nthey want? You also can generally establish, in rooting\ninterest, you can establish the personal connection to the plot. Luke doesn't really want to become\na Jedi. He doesn't really hate the Empire, till they kill his parent figures, and suddenly\nit's personal. That phrase, \"suddenly it's personal,\" there's a reason why that is become\na clich\u00e9 of storytelling, because one of the things that you do in establishing rooting\ninterest is you make sure that there is a reason that your protagonist is connected\nto the plot. Number three up here is progress. This is\nrelating back to the plot stuff we said. Establish the progress, the sense of progress that you're\ngoing to have with the character. In other words, how are they going to change. You do\nthis by showing a flaw that they have, or you establish some sort of journey they're\ngoing to go on. This is dovetailing into all the stuff we talked about with plotting.\nThe goal for this one is, oftentimes this will be driven by a sense of mystery or a\nquestion. Will they be able to become the thing that we know inside they can become?\nWill they be able to-- Will Spiderman become a superhero? What's his journey? What's our\narc? How are you going to signpost this character changing? What is supposed to change?\nBoy, I wrote that one bad. That says, \"going to change.\" We'll fix it in post. We actually\nwon't. So these are your primary tools in creating\na character that we want to read about. You are either going to make us like them, or\nyou're going to give them a motivation that sounds really interesting, or you're going\nto show them on a journey where they themselves are changing and we want to see what happens.\nYou can do all three. You can do one of the three very well. If I'm relating these, a\nfew years ago I came up with this idea that I could really describe a lot of characters\non a sliding scale with three different toggles, three different sliding scales. I wrote one\nover there, but I'm going to do it on this board. The first one's likeability, the second\none was proactivity, and the third one was", "765": " competence. And that characters tended to\nfall somewhere on a scale of these three ideas. I relate these three ideas to these three\ngoals of making you want to read about a character. Now, these things intermix, and they are not\ndistinct from one another. Your proactivity and your competence are generally going to\ngo hand in hand, for instance. But the idea is that your likeability is how much empathy\nyou establish for the character in your story. Your proactivity relates to their motivation\nand what they're doing to achieve that motivation. And their competence has to do with where\nthey are on that kind of progress scale of getting better at whatever they want to do.\nDo you understand that when I say competence, I'm not necessarily just meaning how good\nthey are at swordplay? A person's-- if you were writing a story about someone that was\nvery shy, that the arc of the character was that they were going to become very outgoing\nand then run for the presidency. Well, the core competence for the character is that\nshyness versus introvert/extrovert thing, where they are learning how to stand up and\ntalk in front of people, which is still a competence slider. Yes, they're not learning\nhow to wield a sword or use the one power, but they are still growing in competence in\nsome area that specifically involves the plot. What I realized is, I could have characters\nmoving on any one of these actual scales to create a sense of motion and progress for\nthe story. For instance, a character who is growing less and less likeable through the\ncourse of the story can be a really interesting story. It's a different story, however, than\na character who is growing increasingly in likeability through the course of a story.\nIn the same way, a lot of characters start off inactive and become proactive, and that\nis the way that they are moving. A lot of characters start off with no competence and\nmove up in competence. You don't usually move down in competence, but there are a few really\ninteresting movies about someone losing their competence. The idea is that your motion here\nis part of how you're telling your story. Now I want to stop here and mention something\nthat a friend of mine, Howard Taylor, calls an iconic hero. This is a phrase I think he\ngot from Jim Zub. The idea behind an iconic hero is a hero who does not change on any\nof these three, or if they do change, they change very slightly on one of these three\nthrough the course of a given story. These are your-- James Bond is usually the classic\nexample of the iconic hero, though with various reboots they will move him down in competence\nand then slowly move him back up again. So it really kind of depends on which story you're\ntalking about. Same thing with a lot of the superheroes.\nA lot of the superheroes, it's like, we know where they are on this line, and we're going\nto have an adventure with them experiencing this. An iconic hero generally is going to\nhave one or all three of these ramped to the top so that they cannot move anywhere else\nbecause they are already as competent and capable as they can be. These can be fun to\nread about. You don't have to have progress on these scales in order to have a story.\nBut I have found the majority of stories I really like are involving a lot of motion\non these scales by different characters. For instance, we have Star Wars, one of my\nfavorite movies, the original, where we have lots of movement here. At the beginning of\nthe story, where would you say Han Solo is on these three things? Likeability, where's\nHan on likeability? We kind of like him, but we're like, yeah, right. Where is Han in proactivity?\nDepends on which of these things you're talking. But yeah, Han has to kind of pushed into things.\nHe does shoot first. But where it comes to you need to give him a lot of money, he's\njust sitting there. Where is Han in competence? Han thinks he's up here, but he's actually\ndown here. Right? That's the fun of Han, is he probably knows where he is on the other\nones, but he's not-- And through the course of the story, we are going to boost his likeability.\nWe're going to boost his proactivity a ton by making him come back and not having to\nget paid to save everybody. And his competence basically stays the same, but, you know, that's\nHan. Where is Luke? He's pretty high in likeability,\nI'd say, from the get-go. That\u2019s Luke\u2019s job is you come into the story; you see him\nlooking at the twin sunset. You have him fixing things for his parents and wishing he could\nbe whatever. The whole point of Luke is to establish empathy. His goal is-- we go, Luke\nis supposed to be up there. Whether you actually like him or not, this is what his role is\nsupposed to be. But where is he in proactivity. He thinks\nhe want-- he might actually be a little bit-- no, he's probably down here. He thinks he\nwants to go off and be a fighter pilot. Has he actually done it? No. He has to get booted\nout of things just like Han does. Where is Luke's competence? Yeah, yeah. He's\na good pilot. He doesn't have to learn that. It's kind of like Luke has two. He's up here\nand down there. You'll see this in a lot of things, where a character's really good in\none area, but really lacking in another. The main place he has to learn, though, is in\nthe Force. His growth arc is for him being in the Force from here to, like, here. Then\nthe next one goes here, back down to here, and then the next one it's like here. Well,\nhe's already there. Then he's up here. This is the idea with Luke's character.\nWhere is Leia on likeability? Yes. Leia's pretty darn high on likeability. We start\nout as little ship being chased by big ship, and things like that. Where is Leia in proactivity?\nCLASS: High. BRANDON: Very high. Yeah. Leia's the only\none who does anything in the movie. Everybody else has to be shoved into it, even Obi Wan\nKenobi, by Leia. Like, Leia and R2 are basically the only people who do anything in the movie.\nAnd where is Leia in competence? CLASS: Yeah, in her realm, she's probably\npretty high. Leia's pretty iconic, wouldn't you say? The story is not necessarily about\nLeia changing. It's about the growth in these other things.\nI find it a lot of fun just kind of thinking about where do various characters fall on\nthis, what characters are horribly unlikeable, but hugely proactive and competent, so we\nread about them anyway. People like a lot of villains, like say, Joker. Generally it's\nlike, we've got someone who's hugely proactive, middle competence, but makes up for it in\nproactivity, and generally not very likeable. But we want to read about them because that\nproactivity just grabs ahold of us. They have", "1257": " really interesting motivations. Usually when\nsomeone is high on the proactivity scale and they are not going to be changing on that,\nyou establish a really stellar motivation. What is Leia's motivation in Star Wars? Save\nthe galaxy, right? She has huge motivation that only gets higher through the course of\nthat story, in that she's basically the only one trying to save the galaxy, the only one\nleft after everybody else gets killed. But Luke, what is his motivation? He wants\nto go off and-- he wants to look at the twin sunset and get out there. Instead of establishing\nthis really strong motivation at the beginning of the story, we have to lean back on empathy\nfor Luke. Han's motivation? Get money. So we lean a\nlot on Han's competence at the beginning. He's the person that can shoot the other guy\nbefore the other guy can shoot him. He's the guy who can get this ship to run past the\nenemy blockade, or whatever, that's trying to stop them. He is the guy who can get them\nwhere they need to go. We like Han because he's competent, and that competence makes\nhim cool. Now we find out that he maybe has an overinflated opinion of how good he is\nat some of these things, just by his actions, like chasing an entire group of Storm Troopers\nby himself. But the idea is that we're going to have each\nof these characters doing a different thing for us in the movie, and we start off strongly\nwith each of them kind of in a different realm. This is a great way to do your storytelling.\nThis is why so often you have the young hero who kind of needs to be forced out, but has\na hidden competence and is really likeable, and then you also have this old, wise mentor,\nwho is highly competent, but maybe is not necessarily as likeable, as relatable. Not\na lot of people relate to Gandalf. They do kind of, because Tolkien does a decent job,\nand Jackson does an even better job, of making him likeable. But this idea of, I'm more like\nthe guy in the shire than I am like the powerful wizard, is generally the way that stories\nwork. There's a reason, I often say, why Spiderman\ntends to be a lot of people's favorite superhero. It's because he starts off very establish\nempathy likeable. Rather than starting the story with him having all these powers, it\nhits empathy, empathy, empathy. He reads comic books and plays video games, target audience.\nHe gets bullied at school, target audience. He's a nice guy who's in love with the girl\nnext door but is too shy to go talk to her, target audience. Then what is his journey?\nCompetence skyrocketing through the roof. Extremely likeable at the start, and we're\njust going to show him becoming awesome. He starts as Frodo. He ends as Aragorn. That\njourney, getting to see Frodo become Aragorn, is a really powerful story to tell.\nWhy do I hit on this? Why do I talk about this? What is the point? The point is to start\nyou thinking about your characters and the story you want to tell, and their role in\nthat story. Stories work by a sense of progress. Plots\nmove because we see things changing. And you're going to want to decide with your characters\nif how much them changing is a part of what you want to make people turn your page, or\nif instead you are just going to have your story be competence overload and watching\nreally cool people do really cool things. Oceans 11, really cool people doing really\ncool things. Is there a journey in that? Not really. We are just going to be awesome and\nwisecracking, and we're going to accomplish cool things.\nDifferent types of stories then, for instance, Spiderman, where almost always there is an\noverlap of a change in character motivations over time, signified by a change in proactivity.\nWhat does he do at the start? Let's the villain get away. How does that change his motivations?\nIt makes it personal. Suddenly he needs to", "1534": " be more motivated. And usually you will often\ninterweave a change on proactivity with a change in competence overlapping one another,\nto the point that by the end the character's motivation has shifted. We call this in storytelling,\nscreenwriters talk about this a lot. At the beginning of a story, you often show a difference\nbetween what the character wants and what they need. Spiderman wants to be famous and\ncool; he thinks. What does he need? He needs-- what he needs is to understand that with great\npower comes great responsibility. He needs to understand that the things he wants should\nbe used for good instead of evil, and he needs to have a motivation shift. You see this very,\nvery commonly in this type of story also, where what the character says they want in\nthe beginning is not actually what they need. That contrast can create interesting character\nconflict. Now the last thing I want to talk about this\nbefore we move on to another topic is this idea of flaws, limitations, and handicaps.\nI think that Sanderson's Laws, the humbly named Sanderson's Laws, have a lot of application\nto characterization. If we're going to look", "1617": " at Sanderson's First Law as this law of foreshadowing,\nI would say that if you apply it to characters, we are looking at motivation. A lot of times\nwhen characters go wrong, when I'm reading works by new writers, or when one of my books\nhas gone wrong and I'm getting beta reader feedback that confuses me, it is because I\nhave not properly established character motivation at the start of the story, so that when they\nlater make a decision or accomplish something, it feels in line with who they have become\nand according to their motivation. A lot of times if dialog feels stilted, if\nyour readers are like, something's wrong with this dialog, it's not a one-to-one, but a\nlot of times what's happened is you have established a character as one type of character. Their\nmotivations are a certain set of motivations. But when you get to this conversation you\nrealize, \"I need an argument here. It'll make the conversation more interesting.\" So you\nhave an argument between them and someone else and the reader's like, \"This feels stilted.\nThis feels cardboard.\" What they really mean in that instance is you are having a character\nact contrary to their motivations in order to move the plot in some way.\nSometimes this means you need to revise that scene so they work according to their motivations,\nand you will have a better scene. Sometimes it just means you need to back up and establish\nmotivation. One of the things that's fascinating about characters, about human beings in general,\nis that we tend to wear a lot of hats, and we often have conflicting motivations that\nare driving us in different directions. You probably have these as well. You have a, perhaps,\nduty to your fam and what your fam wants of you, and your own sort of duty to your own\ninner desire to become a novelist instead of a doctor.\nBrandon going to college had both of these motivations working on him. At home they're\nlike, \"You're going to be a doctor, right?\" And he was saying, \"Yes, I'm a biochemistry\nmajor. That's kind of the point.\" But inside I was screaming, \"No!\"\nYou have a lot of these. Often times, the intersection between our family life, our\nsocial life, our religious life, and all of these things create conflicts. If you can\nproperly show this out of the character, readers will not feel that the character is acting\nagainst their motivations. Readers will accept this. In fact, sometimes it is dangerous to\ngive a character only one, single motivation. My example of this is a-- worked much better\n10 years ago when I taught this class in the early years. Any of you watch Lost?\nSTUDENT: Yes. BRANDON: OK, there's, like, three of you.\nSo in Lost-- oh, nice. In Lost there is a", "1791": " character named Michael, I got his name right,\nright? Who has an extremely strong establishment of empathy, in that he is a father who has\nkind of been a bad, deadbeat father and has decided to be a good father now. He loves\nhis son. He's got a lot of empathy, and he's got an established motivation. This man loves\nhis son and wants to be a good father. You would think that would be a recipe for a really\nstrong character. He is everyone's least favorite character. The Lost guy is nodding his head.\nEveryone hates Michael. Maybe not everybody, but almost everyone. And this is really strange.\nIt's a great case study for you to study, because in the show, Michael's son gets captures\nand kidnapped by an evil, mysterious group. And you would think, all right, we've got\na father who's trying to be better. We see him moving up in likeability. He's got an\nestablished motivation. He loves his son and his son's been kidnapped. This is a really\npowerful story, and everyone hated it. Because Michael became one note.\nThe characters would get together to plan what they needed to do for the next step of\nwhatever they were trying to accomplish, and it would be like, character one talks about\nthis, character two talks about this, Michael, \"My son!\" and then the next character. And\nthen they go to another situation and they'd all be doing something else, and he'd yell,\n\"What about my son?\" They're like, \"What do you want for lunch, Michael? We have sandwiches\nor--\" \"My son! Where's my son?\" Right? It became so one note that everybody hated it.\nNow this is-- I point to two problems with this. The first one being one-note character.\nA one-note character whose emotional state does not change or vary will get very tiring,\nunless you do something else to make sure that there is a lot of progress going on,\nand that's the bigger problem. We never really saw any progress that he was making or that\nanyone could make toward saving his son, and so because of it, it felt like every time\nhe yelled, \"My son! But my son!\" was just reminding us that we hadn't made any progress,\nthat nothing was happening, that all it was is, yeah, Michael's going to yell about his\nson. And it got very distracting and annoying because all sorts of exciting other things\nwere happening. And we thought, we're like, \"I should care about this guy's son. I really\nshould. But he's boring, so I don't want to hear about his son.\" And this is a kind of\nflaw in approaching how that story was written. Now Lost, particularly Season 1, is fantastic.\nI would hold up a lot of that writing against a lot of other television show writing and\nthings like this. But it did have this one kind of glaring flaw. Was that Season 1 with\nMichael? Yeah. Right off the bat. You kind of contrast that to a character who\nshould not be very likeable to us. He is a drug addict who is doing almost everything\nhe can to get more drugs. He's played by a Hobbit, which does help, I'll admit. But you\nshouldn't-- he should be kind of low on likeability and things like this. But he often ranks as\npeople's favorite character in the whole season. This is Charlie. Did I get his name right?\nCharlie was my favorite character. In a lot of ways, he shouldn't have been nearly as\nlikeable as he was. But he was proactive, and he was trying, and we saw his progress\nthrough the course of the season, where at the end of the season he turned down the drugs.\nThey found a big stash of drugs and Charlie, like, he had some mistakes in the middle,\nbut then they sent him on another one in Season 2. He relaxed. But at least in Season 1 there's\nthis really great arc, and we saw progress, motion, and proactivity. So the character\nthat on paper you'd be like, \"Who do you like? The drug addict who's hiding his drug addiction\nfrom everyone else, or the man who loves his son and has lost his son?\" On paper you would\nlike this guy. Charlie was way, way better a character and everyone loved him.\nStudy situations like that. When you see a movie and you know you're supposed to like\nsomeone and you don't, ask yourself why. When you read a book and you're really interested\nin the antagonist plot line and you're bored by the protagonist plot line, ask yourself\nwhy, and how does it fit into the ideas of empathy, rooting interest, and progress in\nthat character. But regardless, establish motivation, Sanderson's First Law.\nSecond Law, flaws, limitations, handicaps. Now, we talk a lot in building characters\nabout character quirks. On one hand, I like this idea, that we talk about character quirks,\nstretching ourselves to do something a little more interesting and a little more different.\nBut sometimes it is too easy to mistake a", "2119": " quirk for a personality. The way that you,\nat least I divide between the two, is I make sure, when I'm coming up with flaws, limitations,\nhandicaps, these sorts of things, that they are going hand in hand with something on this\nboard. When I add interesting quirks to a character, I want to make sure that those\nquirks of character are somehow fitting into this.\nNow a lot of times you can do this in a simple way. For instance, if you're going to have\nthe quirk, the character is a stamp collector. This is an action adventure story. The character\nis probably not going to-- stamp collecting does not play a lot into the actual main plot.\nBut what you can do is you can establish this character being proactive in a very small\nsphere when they can't be proactive in a large sphere. If you start off the story and show\nthe great lengths they will go to to get this stamp that they really want, and then you\nshow they collect the stamps because they don't get to travel because they don't have\nthe funds for it, or maybe they're too sick for it, and they dream of traveling, and they\nopen their book, and they put the stamps in of the places that they would have gone if\nthey didn't have this handicap. Then suddenly you have a character who has an interesting\nquirk, and you have established a huge amount of empathy, and you have started to establish\nmotivation. When they get invited on an adventure and\nhave to go on it despite their handicaps or limitations, you know this character is like,\n\"Wait a minute. We have to go to Morocco?\" And you've seen they don't have Morocco yet\nin their stamp book. And even though they don't think they can do it and they're mostly\nnot proactive, and they're a character who's mostly been sitting in their house, you will\nbe like, \"You know what? I can believe this character will take this jump to go to Morocco\non this crazy quest with whoever,\" Nicholas Cage, let's say. Because that's what Nic Cage\ndoes. He shows up and takes you to Morocco. Or . . . or to the Cthulhu mythos, so stay\naway. But regardless, you can make that leap. And if you've got a quirk that can somehow\nconnect all of these things, you are going to have a much stronger character. Rather\nthan, oh, so random, this character is a taxidermist, and it doesn't really matter. It doesn't spiral\nin. They just like taxidermy. Yes, that could be interesting. But if you can connect it,\nit's going to be better. I think the same way about flaws, handicaps,\nlimitations. Now, I do divide in my head what these three things are as different things.\nYou do not have to use my definitions. But kind of as a reminder, a flaw is something\nthat the narrator is indicating that is wrong with the character that they should have fixed\nby now. Something that they were capable of fixing before, hadn't quite managed to do\nit, and through the course of the story you are indicating that flaw, they are either\ngoing to learn to fix this thing, or it's going to be their downfall. Their great hubris,\nif you're in a Greek play, is kind of classic for this. But it's a thing that they have\ncontrol over. A handicap I put as something that must be\novercome, absolutely must be overcome, but is something that is not the character's fault\nand they have no power over whether this thing can be changed. Now some handicaps through\nthe course of the story will be evaporated by the story. But the point is, the character\nup to this point, you don't blame a character for being born blind. This is a handicap,\nand you frame the story a very different way. A limitation, for me, is a thing that is not\nto change, not to even overcome. It is a constraint you work within that you don't necessarily\nwant the character to overcome. The fact that Peter Parker loves Aunt May and doesn't want\nher to come in danger is a limitation of your story, and that should generally not change\nthrough the course of the story. But it is something the character would have power over.\nYou just don't want him to change it, right? That is kind of how I divide these three things\nin my head. When you're building your character, I would\nrecommend that you think about limitations, flaws, handicaps, and ask yourself how does\nthat create motivation for the character, and how does that create story? Just like\nwith magic systems, most of your stories are going to hit the character in a place where\nthey have a flaw, a handicap, or a limitation. Most of your conflict is going to arise out\nof the face that they have flaws, handicaps, limitations.\nLet's stop and ask for questions. That was a big old firehose of stuff. So let's see\nwhat you guys want to talk about and let me ask. Go ahead.\nSTUDENT: How do you deal with this when you're", "2449": " with multiple character point of view/\nBRANDON: Excellent question. How do you work with multiple character point of views in\nthis? One of the first things I will decide is how\nmuch viewpoint time I'm going to give to each of these characters, and the more viewpoint\ntime you have, the most nuanced you can be in a lot of these things.\nI'll get to you in just a sec. One of the best ways to make a character feel\nreal is to not be writing them to a role. This is something I learned early in my career.\nI often share this story, so I'm sorry if you've heard it before. But early in my career,\nI had a big problem writing female characters in my books. This was before I got published.\nI would get feedback back. They'd be like, \"This is a really exciting adventure. All\nthe women feel like cardboard cutouts that you have set into your story that people barely\ninteract with, that are part of the set dressing.\" And this bothered me a lot. That's half my\ncharacters. Well, that's 10% of my characters, because I was a young man writing books who\nhadn't realized that yet. But it should have been 50% of the characters.\nI thought about it a lot. I worked on it.", "2524": " And it was not, like, one revelation that\nmade me get better at it. But one of the big things that changed for me was I started to\nrealize I was writing characters to roles. I would say, this is the hero. Therefore they\nhave this. This is the love interest. That is her role. I am going to write her as the\nlove interest. This is the goofy sidekick. I am writing the goofy sidekick to a specific\nrole. This was really limiting my ability to make the characters feel real.\nWhen I started to kind of embrace this idea that every character is the hero in their\nown story. Every character, they're the protagonist, I should say, in their own story. They may\nnot be the hero, but they are the protagonist. Every character sees themselves as the main\ncharacter. Every character has passions, desires, dreams, hopes, all of these things, that would\nhave continued on existing if the main plot hadn't run into them like a freight train.\nAnd it became very important to me to start establishing who all these characters were\nand who they might have become if the plot hadn't taken over their lives.\nNow, that's all a big preamble to the less time you have with a character, the more difficult\nit is to write them to anything but a role. This is kind of going to be a give and take,\na push and pull, that you have with your characters. If a character's only going to be \"onscreen\"\nfor one chapter, they aren't going to have a viewpoint in that chapter, what can you\ndo? Well, in that case, you generally-- your best bet is to give them one identifying characteristic\nthat does not seem to dovetail into their role. It can force yourself to kind of write\nthem to a personality rather than just to, this is the person who comes on stage, gives\nthe hero their sword, and then walks off stage. But, right, how do you do this for multiple\ncharacters? When I am building a story, I'm always kind\nof looking for friction points between the setting and different parts of the setting,\nbetween the setting and the main plot I'm coming up with. And I'm saying, what if I\nput a character at that friction point. And I'm trying to make sure that each of my main\ncharacters has multiple motivations that make sense and is going to be moving somewhere\non these sliding scales, is trying to accomplish things. And I ask myself what are they trying\nto accomplish before the plot happens, and how do they work into what the plot is doing,\nand how can I make sure that they have a personal connection to the plot. This is much easier\nif you have multiple viewpoints. If you don't, you can still do it. Takes a lot of practice.\nAll right? Go ahead.\nSTUDENT: Why would characters have motivations and not goals? Why use motivations over the\nword goals?", "2704": " BRANDON: Right. A couple reasons for this.\nGoals can be accomplished and then your story is done. Motivations continue. Motivations\nare much easier as you as an author to kind of get in your head who this character is.\nA goals would be something like win the championship. The motivation is why do they want to win\nthe championship. Giving them a goal is OK. Giving them a motivation, letting the reader\nunderstand why they want to live the championship is actually where most of your story is going\nto lie, because it can then intertwine with things like the character's sense of progress\nand stuff like that. You don't always have time for this. For instance,\nif we go back to Star Wars, which I use a lot, we don't really know in the movie why\nHan Solo-- well, we do. He wants to pay off Jabba the Hutt, so he won't die. Right? That's\nmotivation. That's not as strong as why did he become a smuggler? Why did he do this?\nAnd all of that sort of stuff, they just couldn't get into. But they gave him a goal. I need\nto get money. Why? To pay off Jabba the Hutt. His goal then changes. My friends are more\nimportant than paying off Jabba the Hutt. Gee, I hope this doesn't come back to bite\nme. So goals can shift. Motivations kind of become a core of who the character is. And\nI just think it's better overall to be asking yourself those why questions. You don't always\nhave to establish them, like I said. But asking yourself why does Luke want to get off world?\nWhy does Princess Leia want to save the universe? That one doesn't work as well because, basically,\ndestroying all life in the universe, bad idea. But there we go.\nOther questions? We'll go back here. STUDENT: How can you use your story to teach\nyour character the lessons they need, instead of having the character learn the lessons\nthey need and making the story go around that. BRANDON: Right.\nSTUDENT: Say you've got a character that you couldn't control. They controlled themselves.\nHow could you write a story that would help", "2829": " them learn?\nBRANDON: All right. Repeated for the internet audience, how can you make the story get the\ncharacters to become who they need to be? And there was a second part of this. If your\ncharacters don't want to do what you want them to do, how do you make them do what you\nwant to do? This is-- let's do that second question first.\nPeople often ask me what do I do if my characters just don't want to do what I want them to?\nWhich is an interesting question to answer, because it's a very discovery writer question\nfor a very outline writer author, even someone who kind of discovery writes their characters.\nI generally don't think in terms of my characters doing things I don't want them to. But I understand\nthe mindset. What you're meaning is, generally you're writing along, and you're like, \"This\ncharacter's developing to be someone that wouldn't do what I have planned for them to\ndo.\" Or \"They're going in a really interesting direction, and I really like this interesting\ndirection, and I kind of feel like I want to keep writing on it. But it's going to go\nway off topic from what everyone else is doing.\" Or things like this. And I get that sense.\nI understand that. When I get into that situation, what I do\nis, I back up and I say, \"All right. Let's take a hard look at this story. Do I need\nto rebuild my story to fit who this character's becoming? Is the story a stronger version,\nis it a stronger story, if this character continues on this path? Or is this character\ngoing to completely take over the story, and it's going to turn it into something completely\ndifferent?\" I will either pull out the character, set them aside, and rewrite a character from\nscratch, or I will rebuild my outline completely to match where this character is going.\nI do the second more often than the first. Because if I'm really interested in a character,\npersonally, I am really good with plot and setting. I know I can rebuild that plot and\nthat setting. If I've captured something in a character that's really working, I generally\nwant to see where that character goes, and I rebuild my plot for them. That's a different\nquestion than the first one, which is how do I arrange the situations so that they will\nteach the characters the thing I want them to teach. I would say, you need to hit those\ncharacters in the places it will hurt. If what you need is a character to stop being\nselfish, you need their selfishness on screen at some point to cause that character a lot\nof pain, or the people around them a lot of pain. If you want a character to make a difficult\ndecision later on, show them failing to make that decision early on and show the consequences.\nHit your characters hard in their flaws if you want the story to encourage them to change.\nRight here. STUDENT: How do you flesh out and make non-viewpoint\ncharacters interesting if your main characters either don't know their motivations or are\nmisunderstanding them? BRANDON: All right. If your main character,\nyour viewpoint character, doesn't understand a side character's motivation or misunderstands\nthem, how do you make sure that that character, that side character still works?\nWell, the epic fantasy author's answer is add a viewpoint. That is usually bad advice\nfor most genres. In this case, do as I say, not as I do. Because I will write a 400,000-word\nbook and just add some viewpoints in. Even in my 100,000-word books, I'll sometimes just\nadd viewpoints in. Mary Robinette hates that, by the way. She'll\nread a story by me and be like, \"Why is there this random viewpoint. It does not make--\"\nI'm like, \"Uh, um, yeah. Shush, shush.\" But how do you do it without adding that viewpoint\nin? I would take one of a couple of things. Hanging a lantern on it is that stage play\nterm that lets you make a thing that you think might be a bug into a feature. Hang a lantern\non the setting piece that doesn't look as good as the rest of them, indicating to the\naudience that you will someday make use of that as a plot point.\nIn this case, having a character who is not the main character and not the side character\nsay, \"You really don't get them, do you?\" And then the main character say, \"Yeah, I\ntotally get them. Such and such and such and such.\" And the other character being like,\n\"Oh, man. Oh, man. Someday you are going to be super embarrassed that you just said that.\"\nThat sort of thing can be really handy. What you don't want, why this can be bad is\nif the reader-- I've told you guys about gorillas in a phone booth, right? I haven't. OK. I've\ntold the little class about it. Gorillas in a phone booth is a thing I learned. This will\nrelate, I promise. A thing I learned in college from one of the people in college with me\nin my master's degree. And it stuck with me. He was reading a story of mine, and he said,\n\"This part feels like a gorilla in a phone booth.\" I'm like, \"What?\" He's like, \"Imagine\nyou are watching a movie, and a character is having a conversation with his girlfriend,\nand they are kind of arguing over finances. And then he walks by, looks up, and there's\na gorilla in the phone booth. People don't have phone booths anymore but pretend we're\nlike 20 years ago when these were a thing. There's a gorilla in the phone booth, and\nthen he keeps on walking and going. What the gorilla in the phone booth does is\nit draws the reader's attention to the point that their mind keeps coming back to it and\nmakes them unable to focus at the task at hand. Once you've seen the gorilla in the\nphone booth, it is so irreconcilable with the story you thought you were seeing that\nyour mind keeps going back and you suffer an extreme detachment from the main story\nin a way that is very bothersome. This often happens with readers if they think you as\na writer haven't noticed something or have made a big mistake. And it starts to be this\nlittle thing that pushes them further and further out of the story, even if it's a small\nthing, where they're like, \"But X! But, but how can you not notice this?\" Other times\nit happens because you mention something that's really interesting as a tease, but then don't\ngive enough information about it, to the point that readers keep worrying about it.\nI've read, to kind of paraphrase, some student works where a person gets stabbed in the hand,\nand then has a conversation with another person about something completely unrelated. I'm\nlike, \"They are bleeding all over the floor. I cannot pay attention to this other conversation,\nno matter how important it is, because they're bleeding to death!\" You want to avoid letting\nyour side characters do that to your story. Hanging a lantern on it is one of the good\nways where you are basically saying to the reader, \"This isn't a flaw in the story. I\nknow. I am going to deal with it eventually.\" What that does is the reader then is like,\n\"Oh, thank goodness.\" They file in the back of their head that \"this is a plot point.\nI noticed it. I'm smart. It's going to be relevant later on. Thumbs up. Let me focus\non what the story is on right now.\" It can be very handy with these sorts of things.\nThis gets very complicated when you have an untrustworthy narrator, which is kind of what\nyou're going with here, right? This happens all the time in The Wheel of Time with Mat\nCauthon, where Mat assesses a situation and it is completely wrong, humorously so. And\nyou as the reader are supposed to understand this. Dramatic irony, the reader understands\nthings that the characters don't. This can get very tricky. It can be very hard to write\nthis sort of thing. But if you get it right the readers are going to love it.\nThere's a couple hints on that. All right. Go ahead.\nSTUDENT: What's the most of this that you've", "3319": " done in post?\nBRANDON: What's the most of this I've done in post? Good question. I will often, I would\nsay half of the time, throw away the first through third chapters of a book. And part\nof the reason for this-- I did this in Skyward. Skyward, when I was starting off, in fact\nI keep meaning to post these. Adam, we'll get these up, right? The alternate beginnings.\nSkyward has three different beginnings, and they were all about me trying to get likeability,\nproactivity, and competence down for the main character Spensa at the beginning, also in\ntone and all these promises. A lot of times, by the middle of the book I understand what\nsomeone's arc is pretty strongly, and I know where I'm going, but the beginning has been\nreally rough and doesn't match who that character has become. I just consider it-- like, I know\nI'm generally going to throw away the first few chapters. In that case, it wasn't the\nprologue. It was chapter 1 and 2. But we'll get them up. You guys can read them. We did\nget the outline up, right? Did we post that up here?\nADAM: It's on the brandonsanderson slash-- BRANDON: Right. But we were going to write\nit on the board. OK. Yes. Adam's going to", "3394": " write, on the board, where you find the outline\nfor Skyward. I promised you I'd get that up, and we keep forgetting to put it on the board.\nSo those internet people who've been asking, you'll be able to find it here. We'll try\nto get the other beginning chapters of that up. Though basically the idea is here that\nI'm totally OK rewriting my beginning if my ending is working.\nOne place that I've changed it dramatically, I think I've talked about Mistborn 3, where\nthere was a character who was not proactive at all. This is a character who was going\nthrough a depressive-- deep into depression because of things that happened in the middle\nbook, and their plot was excruciating to read, because they were just depressed the whole\ntime. I realized a sense of progress, even downward, is way better than nothing at all.\nI ripped out all of those character scenes. I wrote them all from scratch, and in this\none the character had an action they were doing that each thing they discovered in this\naction brought them further down. There was, like, a countdown of, he's read 200 of these\nbooks and found no answers. He's getting more depressed. And that slide worked way better.\nThat's one of the biggest ones I've done. The other, of course, big one I talked about\nin class is when I ripped out half of Dalinar's chapters from The Way of Kings and I replaced\nthem with Adolin chapters, because the character was feeling schizophrenic, because he was\nboth confident that he was right, that the visions he was seeing was leading him toward\nsomething important, and totally frightened he was insane. And these did not jive at all.\nWhat it turned into was he had a huge problem with all three of these things. He was less\nlikeable because he was wishy washy. And he was less proactive because every action he\ntook was undercut by him worrying he was insane. Moving that out to two characters so that\nthe external voice was saying, \"I really think you're insane, Dad,\" made Adolin way more\nsympathetic, because we've all had family members and loved ones who've gone through\nan illness and we're really worried that this illness is hurting them and changing them,\nand what do we do? It made Dalinar more empathetic, because we've all been the person that people\nhaven't believed when we've had something that is a major thing. We're like, \"I can\ngo be a writer. I'm not crazy. I'm a prophet.\" Well, maybe we haven't had that one. But that\nidea, splitting those out, added the likeability to both of them, and it let them both be proactive\nrather than back and forth. Those are probably the two biggest changes I've made in any of\nmy books. Yeah, go ahead.\nSTUDENT: How do you separate your characters' voices?\nBRANDON: How do I separate my characters' voices? What a fantastic question. This goes\ninto what I think I've told you guys before, the grand skill of telling science fiction\nand fantasy, of writing, which is the ability to world build through the eyes of characters.\nYour go-to here should be letting the character's background, their motivations, and their personality\ninfluence their descriptions and their diction. Now, the kind of-- you can go way too far\non this. But an example of this, Robert Jordan has a character who is very high. She is the\nAmyrlin Seat. She is leader of the magic users in this world, basically the highest position\nyou can be. She came from a bunch of fishermen. Her parents were fishers. So she still uses\nmetaphors about getting fish and about things like this, which makes her a delight to read,\nbecause this character that you expect to be regal and queenly is talking about getting\nfish because that's her background. That's a good example of using the contrast there\nto get someone across. But letting someone's background influence the metaphors they use.\nIt should be more than-- for instance, the cliched way to do this is the character who\nhas a scientific mind doesn't use contractions. You've all probably read this or seen this.\nThe very smart person says cannot instead of can't. Totally valid. You can totally do\nthat. But it should go further than that. You should be saying this character has a\ntraining in the academy. They have a PhD. They're going to speak differently. They're\ngoing to be rhetorically grounded. They're going to use-- they're going to arrange their\narguments in such a way to use rhetoric. This character does not. This character comes from\nliving on the streets and going with their gut. Their argument is going to be, \"You're\nwrong. I know you're wrong because I've stabbed three people like you. And they all died,\nand I lived. You're wrong.\" This person's going to be like, \"You're wrong because of\nthis and this and this. Can't you see how great my logical arguments are?\"\nThat is way stronger than this character uses no contractions and this character uses slang.\nYou should still have this character use slang and this character's diction reflect the academy,\nbut the way that they argue, the way that they see the world-- A character who grew\nup like I did with an upper middle class background is going to have a very different perspective\non how likely they are to achieve their dreams and goals than a person who has a lower, low\nclass upbringing. These things should reflect in your characters. Try to get this across.\nIn fact, one of the best things you can do to learn how to write stronger writing is\nlearn how to make your dialog work without dialog tags and without any descriptions around\nit. Now, you rarely will put this in a book, but\nif you can write a scene where three or four different characters are having an argument,\nand we can track who is who with no dialog tags, then you're starting to get there. If\nwe're like, \"Oh, look at this. This person's paragraphs are always huge and well thought\nout, and this person's paragraphs are always short sentences with lots of exclamation points.\nAnd this character always stutters and pauses and has lots of ellipses. And wow, I can follow\nthem all because of the diction, and of course, they're arguing for different things from\ndifferent directions. And this one just used a metaphor about iron working, where this\nmetaphor talked about burning pages.\" When you can do that and let your dialog be that\nstrong, you are getting there. One of the things that I see, and I do this\ntoo much too, in a lot of writing, is being sloppy by letting your-- the things you put\naround the dialog do the heavy lifting. \"I'm not very happy with you,\" he said angrily.\nRather than, \"How dare you!\" One is stronger than the other. Your natural instincts, most\nlikely, will be to write, \"I'm not happy with you,\" he said angrily.\nThis is one of the reasons why a lot of writing textbooks and things will say get rid of the\nadverbs, that you should not be using adverbs. I do not go that strong on it. But they also\nsay, don't use sad bookisms. Don't use things like he exclaimed, or he shouted, or things\nlike that. Again, I don't go that far. You'll have to decide where you want to be. J. K.\nRowling loves both of those, and she's the best-selling author of our time. So take all\nthis with a grain of salt. But if you can move that \"angrily,\" if you\ncan cut that and make sure the diction sounds angry, your writing goes up a notch in strength.\nIf you can show in even your descriptions that somebody really hates this other person\nby the way they describe how fiddly they are with their hair and how, of course, their\nperfect shoes are polished, and things like that, rather than saying, \"She really hated\nAmy, because she was a prep.\" If you could never have those lines in your writing and\neveryone gets it, it's going to be way, way stronger writing.\nThis is a continual, life-long quest for most writers that we always are trying to get better\nat, and very few actually get where it's really, really good, and particularly not in first\ndrafts. But that's how you do it. And if you can do that, if you can do the things I'm\njust talking about here, then you are going to sell books fast. Because if you're opening\nchapters are full of almost no information dumps, full of character dialog that snaps\noff the page and tells you who they are by the way that they talk and gets across and\nevokes setting and character just through these sort of contextual clues, then you are\ndoing better than 99% of the people who are submitting books or self-publishing their\nbooks and trying to make it. If you can practice one skill, do that one. All right?\nOK, time for a few more. Go ahead. STUDENT: I'm wondering, how do you craft good\nvillain motivation? BRANDON: How do you craft good villain motivation?\nThis depends on the type of villain you want. Different stories use different types of villains.\nAnd really it's going to depend on how far up or down on the likeability scale is your\nvillain. A villain who's very low on the likeability scale, but very high on the other two will\nbe different than one that you characterize a little bit in the middle. An iconic villain\nsuch as Sauron is very different from a character who is struggling and changing like Gollum.\nGollum is a character who's changing in likeability and proactivity through the course of the\nstory in various different modes, and Sauron doesn't. Sauron is a giant, burning red eye\nthat's going to destroy the world. That is it. Yes, I know the extent-- blah, blah, blah,\nSilmarillion. In the actual story, it's a giant eye that's going to destroy the world.\nThose fulfill two different roles and they're both perfectly valid. But if you want a villain\nwith motivations that make sense, you're going to have to work harder than you worked with\nsomeone like Sauron. Gollum's a great example. It can be a fantastical thing. He just really\nwants this ring. He doesn't even really know why. He's been corrupted by it, but he really,\nreally wants the ring, and we can see that he wants it. He has an established motivation.\nThe fact that he's changing and wavering back and forth is what makes him work.\nI think I told you guys, right? I made my Mom go to Lord of the Rings films when they\nwere coming out 20 years ago. And she had never read a fantasy book before. This was\nbefore I published any, so she hadn't read any of mine. And I took her, and she had two\ntakeaways from those films. The one was, \"Boy, I sure hope Aragorn ends up with that nice\nelf girl. I like her.\" And number two, \"Little Smeagol, please be good.\" And she would say\nthat after, like, the second movie. She's like, \"Smeagol\u2019s going to turn out to be\ngood, right?\" She was hooked by him. I know. It was kind of heartbreaking. Yeah, he gets\nto have his ring. So those characters do different things. Different adaptations of Joker do\ndifferent things. You're going to ask yourself, you do basically\nthe same sorts of things, and you do want to-- you can distinguish in your head between\nvillain and antagonist. It's sometimes helpful to split those two apart. Antagonist is someone\nthat is working against the goals of the main character. Villain is someone who is doing\nexpressly evil things. Those are my definitions. You don't have to use them. But, for instance,\nthe principle in Ferris Bueller's Day Off starts off mostly as antagonist, slightly\nvillainous, and then gets more and more villainous through the way the story progresses.\nBut you can imagine Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive. Tommy Lee Jones is the antagonist\nof that show, but he is not the villain. The villain is someone else. But most of the time\nwith that is Tommy Lee Jones. So you've got to be kind of separating those two out. If\nyou want your villain to work, make sure their motivations, if you want a villain whose motivations--\nsomeone we empathize with, just give them realistic motivations just like the hero or\nprotagonist, then put them at cross purposes with the protagonist for some reason, and\nit'll rip our hearts out. Yeah, go ahead.\nSTUDENT: How do you have an antagonist who's not inherently evil, but is very competent\nand proactive, but you don't want the readers to like?\nBRANDON: How do you make a character who's not evil but is very proactive and competent\nthat you don't want the readers to like? Well, you can show someone not being evil, but also\nnot being good. This is generally the realm. They're not kicking puppies. But they also\nare Javert, classic example. Javert wants to catch Jean Valjean. But he has no mercy.\nHe's not kicking puppies, but he is not merciful at all. We do not like Javert until we start\nto see him humanize, and then he no longer can exist in this system because he has fallen\nout of his role, so he has to jump off a bridge. But Javert is a classic example.\nThe Fugitive, Tommy Lee Jones is another example, though we like him because of this. So you\ncan do this. Anyone cross purpose, if you do this right for your protagonist, and you\nput the antagonist cross purpose of them, even if it's understandable, then we will\nnot want them to succeed. Even sometimes if your hero is the antagonist, as the heroes\nare in Infinity War, you will want the protagonist, who is the villain, to be successful because\nof the way they are protaging, and the way their motivations are established. And so\nyou will watch a movie where the heroes fail and the villain wins, spoiler, where the protagonist\nwins, and the antagonists lose, but the positions are reversed.\nAll right. Let's do one more. Go ahead. STUDENT: How do you write a character who\ndoesn't understand their own motivations or is lying to themselves?\nBRANDON: Right. How do you write a character who doesn't understand their own motivations\nor who is lying to themselves? This is where, number one, small successes\nat the beginning are really handy for establishing this. Having the character be proactive about\nsomething that isn't involved in the larger scope, and showing us they can be, and showing\nus what they actually need through that, and then having them verbally say, \"No, that's\nnot what I need. It's what I never needed,\" is a really good way. First impressions are\nreally important. If you impress upon us that this character is really proactive in their\nsmall sphere, but they don't think they're competent enough to out into the wide world,\nwe will believe what you showed us, not what they say. So make sure your shows are on point.\nThe other way to do this is to have a character that we do trust, who is a trustworthy narrator,\ntell that character the truth, and make sure that we see that and empathize with that,\nso that we are knowing this character's going to learn and change. All right?\nAll right, guys, we'll do Character 2 next week. Write down any questions I didn't get\nto, and we'll do it in two weeks."}, "10": {"0": " BRANDON: All right, let's do class. Today\nwe're on Character Part 2. All right? I am just going to dig into it because this is\nwhat I do. I blab. I've kind of divided today's topic into four different general areas. We're\ngoing to talk about using what we learned last week in order to characterize, and also\nhopefully teach a few other things about writing books that don't quite fit anywhere else.\nBecause books, stories, short stories, they basically are made up of four types of things,\nfour types of writing you're going to be doing. You are going to be doing dialogue, description,\nbeats, and introspection, also called navel", "48": " gazing. This is going to basically be mixing\nthese four things together are what your story is made up of. So we're going to take each\none of these, talk about some strategies for using them, with an eye toward how to characterize\nwith them. We're going to start with dialogue. The question\nbecomes, how do you use dialogue for maximum impact in your writing? There is no, again,\nlike most things, one way you have to do this. There are strategies to use. When people talk\nabout your voice as an author, it's going to come down to how you intermix these and\nhow you decide to use them. Some tips on dialogue. Dialogue, generally,\nis one of the most active ways that you can convey information and characterization, particularly\nwhen there are multiple characters speaking, and it feels like a dialogue. The first thing\nyou want to avoid, if you can avoid it, is avoid having your dialogue sound like monologues.\nUnless you are purposefully writing a monologue. Sometimes you will do this. For instance,\na character will stand up to give a speech, St. Crispin's Day. Or you have a character\nwho has an epilogue in each one of your epic fantasies, which is basically him monologuing\nto an empty room. You will have reasons that you want to do monologues. But you want to\navoid your dialogues feeling like monologues. How you do this is, you generally, here's\na thing you don't want to do, big dialogue chunk, then another character says, \"Ah!\"\nand then big dialogue chunk, and the character says, \"Hmm.\" You will find yourself doing\nthis naturally, and this reads pretty poorly. Now, it reads better than most info dumps\ndone in description or in introspection, so it is a step forward, and once in a while\nyou're just going to have this, because it's basically a monologue disguised as a dialogue.\nBut this is a less effective way to do it. More effective is generally when you have\nit look like a conversation. Bum, bum, buh, person starts to launch into, em dash, gets\ninterrupted by other character who says, \"Wait, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\"\nAnd this character says, \"No, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" And then this\ncharacter says, \"Oh! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?\" And this character's like,\n\"Yeah.\" And then another part of your info dumps. Then this other character's like, \"But\nwhat about this other thing.\" And the character's like, \"We considered that. The blah, blah,\nblah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" And you are breaking your info dumps up and making it\ninto a conversation. This is just going to read way better, and it's going to give you\nway more opportunities to make your dialogue feel like it's expressing character.\nThe thing that we want to get across with all four of these is you want to find strategies\nfor letting your dialogue, description, your action, your introspection either convey likeability\nfor a character, convey proactivity for a character, convey the arc the character's\none, their flaws, in other words, to convey their competence, and their motivation. If\nyou can get those five things into your dialogue for your characters, suddenly your dialogue\nis going to start to pop off the page, look really fresh and interesting, and it's going\nto be expressing character. You can see how you would be doing this. How\nwould you maybe express likeability, or increase likeability for a character in this sort of\nthing? Any suggestions? You want to move that", "290": " character up on the likeability scale.\nSTUDENT: Humor! BRANDON: Humor. They're funny. They're making\na wisecrack. Absolutely. How would you move them down?\nSTUDENT: Whiney. BRANDON: Whiney. Move them down. They're whiney.\nArgumentative without it actually serving a purpose. Not paying attention. Making fun\nof the character in a way that's not funny, that's just cutting them down. You could move\na character in this conversation up or down on that scale.\nHow do you express character's proactivity in a dialogue?\nSTUDENT: They talk a lot. BRANDON: They talk a lot. They're really excited\nabout this idea. They're like me talking about writing. That's going to come across as a\nproactive character. Any other suggestions? STUDENT: Their contributions are meaningful.\nLike, if they're just like not meaningful, then they're--\nBRANDON: Right. They offer-- like, a proactive character would say, \"I can do that, and I\ncould do this to help to.\" They offer. When you're in the group meeting, if you ever do\nthis, and someone volunteers to take a task, that's, like, a great thing. We're all happy\nwhen someone actually volunteers to do something. You can use your dialogue to express that.\nHow can you use the dialogue to express motivation of a character?\nSTUDENT: \"But, oh, my son!\" BRANDON: But, oh, my son. Right. Completely\ncan be overdone, but that is expressing the character's motivation. When the character\ncuts in and says, \"But what about the droid attack on the Wookies?\" in the middle of a\nconversation about something else, that character is expressing part of their motivation. They're\nraising the issue. Get across the character motivations in this. \"When we're on this trip,\ncould we stop and see this place I've always wanted to get a stamp from,\" going back to\nour stamp collector character. You can put these things into the dialogue in a way that's\njust going to express your character. How would you express characters' flaws in\ndialogue? Their journey, in other words. How are you going to get across that they are\nhaving an arc? STUDENT: You could make your character stubborn,\nwhere they are constantly repeating the same thing.\nBRANDON: Yeah, totally. And if you want the arc to work, you're going to show them changing\non that over time through the dialogue choices they make. Any other suggestions, show their\nflaws? STUDENT: Have them say something really stupid.\nBRANDON: Yeah, have them say something really stupid. Or if their character journey is the\njourney of, because sometimes a journey is apprentice to master, they can be asking a\nlot of insightful questions. They don't have to-- the flaw, again, the flaw is not their\nfault, but they still don't know things. They can be asking for information. Later in the\nstory they can be giving the information. I've seen lots of great arcs where character\nlearns something and by the end they're teaching that thing.\nSTUDENT: Have them pointedly not say anything when they really should.\nBRANDON: Yeah, absolutely. All right, how can you show characters' competence? You want\nto move them up on the scale of competence in dialogue. You already answered so we'll\ngo right there. STUDENT: If they know a lot about the issue\nand things other people don't know and put things together no one else has put together.\nBRANDON: One great way to do this, as I mentioned last week, if another character acknowledges\nit, it's going to be more reinforced. So if someone says, \"This, this, and this,\" and\nanother person's like, \"Wow, I didn't realize you were so up to date on this.\" That's going\nto reinforce it to us. Finding ways through the conversation. Or somebody who's really\ncompetent could cut through all of the, say, rigamarole about an issue and get right to\nits core. You are showing a competence. How can you move them down on the competence\nscale? You want to establish that this person is not competent yet. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: They're talking like they think they know a lot about something, but obviously\nthey don't. BRANDON: Exactly.\nSTUDENT: \"I didn't know that.\" BRANDON: Yeah, \"I didn't know that.\" Totally.\nYeah. Or they could ask some really asinine questions. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: If somebody was trying to put humor in a place where it's not appropriate.\nBRANDON: Yeah, humor where it's not appropriate.", "559": " You can see, as you're starting to build your\nstory, if you can master doing some of these things, if you can master getting across all\nof this in dialogue instead of your normal way. There's a reason why we're going to do\nthis one last. You are going to default to this every time, unless you start training\nyourself not to. That doesn't mean that introspection has no place. It does have a place in the\nstory. But you are going to default to it. You are going to end up with these things.\nYou're like, \u201cThis isn't an info dump. This is important, meaningful stuff about the character.\u201d\nFour pages later of the character ruminating about whatever issue that they are trying\nto work on to become a better person, your reader is collapsed on the floor asleep.\nWhereas, if you're doing it like this, and you have three characters with different motivations,\ndifferent flaws, and different areas of expertise, having a conversation together, where at the\nend of the conversation the reader feels like they know all three characters better and\nit's given us the information about the heist they're going to pull off. Suddenly you have\njust mastered characterization in a way that will not put your to sleep.\nWe talked another week, we won't talk a ton about it, but you do want to try to vary your\ndialogue based on the character, aggressive stance versus nonaggressive stance, the character\nwho always asks for more information or clarification versus the character who's like, \"I got it.\nI'm ready to go,\" even if they don't have it.\nOne question I get a lot is on dialect. How often should you use dialect? This is a personal\nchoice. This is a stylistic choice. My default recommendation to you is less is more, even\nfor little tag words that a character uses that distinguish them. I used one of these\nin Elantris. It's based off of a-- we have them in English but it's more like \"eh,\" where\nyou say \"Eh?\" You ask for-- what are these called? The linguists can tell me. They are\na form of conversation where in conversation a lot of languages have a thing you stick\nat the end to ask if the other person's understanding. STUDENT: [inaudible]\nBRANDON: What's that? STUDENT: Back channeling.\nBRANDON: Back channeling. OK. So in Korean it's [kudecho]. \"Isn't that so?\"\nWhich is that part. In Elantris I put in \"kolo?\" If you've read Elantris, this character always\nhas one of these. It's part of the linguistic quirk of this character. My editor cut, like,\nthree quarters of those and said, \"I know that realistically in dialogue people use\nthese all the time, and indeed, you will find in some languages and some conversations every\nsentence is tagged with one of these things to make sure that the person you're talking\nto understands that they can speak up at that point and say if they understand. But you\ndon't need nearly as many as you think you need.\" Any of these things that you are adding\nto the dialogue, consider using them as a light dusting of dialect rather than an all-in.\nThat said, there are some writers who write fantastic pieces with all-in dialect. There's\na nice little section in Name of the Wind that has an all-in dialect section that is\nvery fun. The Wee Three Men by Terry Pratchett is very into this. You might even argue that\na bunch of Star Wars is in dialect with Chewbacca and R2D2 in a dialect we don't understand.\nA lot of times, if you're going to go heavily into dialect, you will need to understand\nthat a lot of readers eyes will glaze over, even if they could figure it out. So be careful\nabout that and give contextual clues of what's going on in the conversation. But this is\nreally just a personal choice sort of thing.", "791": " We're going to go through these fairly quickly.\nSo let's just ask other questions on dialogue, particularly getting across character. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: You talk about the idea of, like, someone always asking more information, or\npeople have different really ways that they-- BRANDON: Yep.\nSTUDENT: The conversation. How do you make that a trend for a character without making\nit seem kind of stiff? BRANDON: Good question. How do you make it\na trend for a character without making it seem kind of stiff?\nNumber one is, again, less is generally more. If you're having the character do this every\nsentence, it's going to get old really fast and it's going to feel stiff very fast.\nNumber two, variety. For almost everything you're doing in your writing, particularly\nwhen it comes down to these sorts of things, variety is king. Having some conversations\nthat go a little bit more like a monologue, mixed with some conversations that read like\nan argument and feel almost like a fight scene with words, having other things where people\nare just shooting the breeze and talking together and stuff is coming out, having a variety\nof different types. And in the same way, the character who always asks for more information\ncan have a variety of ways they do this. The idea is never to have the reader and these\nsorts of things really pick out, this is the character that always asks for more information.\nIf you do your job right, they would be able to tell that this character is talking, but\nthey wouldn't be able to tell you why until you say, well, they often are asking for more\ninformation, or this is the character who is empathetic to how other people are feeling\nand always asks the person who is being quiet in the conversation what they think. And if\nthis character does that several times through the story, your reader's going to pick up\non that subconsciously, and that character's dialogue is just going to feel like their\ndialogue. The king way to show off your skills in this\nis to do dialogue-only sections and to practice them without attributions. This is very hard,\nand it rarely works to keep them in a book. I have one in an Alcatraz book, where that's\nthe joke, is that people keep entering the conversation, and there's a random pirate,\nI think, that wasn't there when the story started. The idea is that it's a joke that\nyou don't give any attributions and people are just yelling at each other.\nBut practicing this can be really handy. Having a three-- it's generally got to be a three-person\nconversation for you to really practice it. Write it without any dialogue tags or any\ndescriptions and see if you can pull off having different characters with different motivations,\ndifferent ways of speaking, that the reader can mostly keep track of who all these people\nare without the tags. Then when you add the tags in and give it a little bit of description\nand stuff, it reads like a really powerful sequence often.\nI usually recommend a couple of short stories I really like that do this very well. One\nis \"They Are Made of Meat,\" which is a two-person, or two-being, conversation. And then there's\nanother great short story called \"Wiki History,\" which is an epistolary story told all through\nforum entries by various characters, where you could strip away the dialogue tags, they\nstill have them in this, and you could still follow what's happening. It's a short story\nthat takes place on a time traveler's forum, and it's really fun. Those are both free on\nthe internet. I can't remember who wrote \"Wiki History,\" but \"They Are Made of Meat\" is on\nTerry Bisson's website. Anyway, let's move on to other questions.\nYeah, go ahead. STUDENT: Sometimes I feel like when I'm reading\na book or writing a story, I have a hard time presenting when a character is lying. Is there\na way to make that obvious to a reader without making it obvious to the other characters?\nBRANDON: Yes. OK, lying.", "1022": " You've got basically two things going on here,\nwhether it's lying as untrustworthy narrator, or whether it's not. We're going to talk about\nuntrustworthy narrator in a little bit, but basically the idea with untrustworthy narrator\nis to show through these one thing and contrast it with introspection that says something\nelse. Oftentimes you say something in introspection, but you show something else through dialogue,\ndescription, beats, and action, and that contrast between the two, that dissonance, is what\nclues the reader in that this is an untrustworthy narrator. That's not the only way to do it.\nBut one of the other ways is to simply have the character find out info in one scene,\nand in the very next scene tell different information to the people around the, which\nwill let us know that everything that character says from the on is a lie. Like, if we know\nthat this character's telling a lie about something else, then we're going to be suspicious\nof everything else they tell, if that makes sense. But we have to know that the character\nknows that information first, and then see the lie being told.\nYou can do this-- one of the great people-- someone asked, I think last week, about how\nyou do things with side characters and characterization. Keep in mind, you can generally do all of\nthis and all of this through someone else's viewpoint for a side character. You can do\na decent amount of this. You just can't generally do much of this. So you have two and a half\nof the four tools for characterizing people who are not your viewpoint characters. The\nreason description is only half is because half or more of your description power is\ncharacterized in the person who's doing the describing, not necessarily the person they're\ndescribing. But two and a half of your four tools exist\nfor all side characters and people you aren't in viewpoints of. So you just have to practice\nmaking sure you get across those people's characterization through dialogue beats and\nthe half description that is about them, rather than relying on introspection. But if you're\ndoing your job and you are practicing, then you are learning how to do these three, and\nnot leaning on this one as a crutch except when you need to. That's just going to make\nyour writing more powerful. Now one little thing to mention about dialogue\nis there is a lot of discussion in writerly circles about how much you should modify your\ndialogue. This is a personal stylistic choice, and you do not have to follow anyone's rules\non this. I think it's useful for you to know the rules, however. Generally, the rule of\nthumb is that pieces of dialogue should have what we call said bookisms at the end. \"He\nsaid.\" That said and asked should be, rule of thumb, 90% of your attributions.\nThe reason this is a rule of thumb is that said and asked are invisible to the reader,\nand it doesn't draw focus away from the dialogue. I generally expand that. My personal philosophy\nis shouted, whispered, and some of these other things are really handy. I use more than I\nreally need. I use noted way more often than I probably need to use it, because it's basically\na meaningless word. If it's been done in the dialogue, it's obvious that they're noting\nit, and things like that. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: If it's just two people dialoguing, like, really quickly, can you take those out?\nBRANDON: Yes, you can take them out. Yeah, so what Dave said in his class is he usually\ntried to make sure that you only went, like, through three exchanges in a two-person dialogue\nbefore you added a beat or another dialogue. But generally, if it's just two people and\nit's quick back and forths, you want to scale way back on your tags. If there are three\npeople in the conversation, or even another person in the room, it's often better to use\nmore tags than you think you need, just because that third person, it's going to be jarring.\nBut, yeah, that's a-- Like, if you were reading a novel version\nof some of this Joss Whedon quippy dialogue between two characters, most of those shouldn't\nhave dialogue tags at all. This goes also in the adverb direction. \"He\nsaid softly.\" Rule of thumb is to avoid those, or to be very sparing with them, or to only\nuse a couple of them to modify tone, like softly or loudly or things like that. Some\npeople will say just take them all out. This is a personal stylistic choice, again. I think\nI may have mentioned J. K. Rowling loves all of these things. She loves using every different\nsynonym of said that she can come up with and putting it in. She is the most successful\nwriter of our time. So this is why you should take these things with a grain of salt.\nBut the why, remember you're chefs, not cooks. The why is that if you aren't leaning on these\nthings, then you often will naturally make your dialogue sharper. If you have to replace\nshouted with someone actually emphasizing a word and being very angry, then you will\nwrite your dialogues more strongly than if you could just say, \"He said angrily, furrowing\nhis brow.\" Generally, writing advice from most professors is going to be cut as much\nof this out as you can and try to let the dialogue do the talking. Ha ha.\nYes. STUDENT: Do you find-- I try to use more of,\nlike, action along with my dialogue. [inaudible]", "1381": " BRANDON: Right. So that's a beat, and we're\ngoing to get to those. That's what a beat means. Variety there is really handy. The\nreason beats are also very good is because a beat, like for instance, \"He slammed his\nhand on the table. 'I am done talking to you.'\" Then you don't need a shouted, you don't need\na he said. We all are framing that, and it also does this kind of pyramid abstraction\nstuff where we're grounding you in the scene and keeping you there.\nThis is also a stylistic choice, how often you use beats in your dialogue. Some writers\nlike a beat almost every line of dialogue. Some writers like to keep only as sparse number\nof beats as they can in order to keep you grounded in the scene and who's talking and\nadd some variety to the said and asked. Personal stylistic choice.\nI find that if you use fewer beats, just like you use fewer adverbs and things like that,\nthat you are naturally going to force yourself to write better dialogue, and the reader's\ngoing to be adding more of those beats in themselves. But this is a stylistic choice.\nBasically, it comes down to if, as you as a writer, how much do you want to be painting\na cinematic picture in your readers' heads and giving them every single action, and how\nmuch do you want to back off on that and have them be imagining it themselves. This is also\ngoing to vary, based on your genre. Some genres like more, some genres like less.\nAlso, it's going to depend on how much you want that dialogue to pop. You can imagine,\non the page, how different it's going to be if you read a scene that looks like this.\nShort dialogue, short dialogue, short dialogue, short dialogue joke, short dialogue. Now change\nthat just in your mind to beat right here. \u201cHe went and scratched his face.\u201d And\nthen beat right here. \u201cShe sat back, folded her arms, and cocked her head.\u201d Beat right\nhere. Beat right here. Beat right here. Instead of reading like bam, bam, bam, bam, rapid\nfire, you're going to get a slower scene. You're going to get an introspective scene,\nwhere you're seeing characters. You're stopping the reader from focusing on the dialogue and\nyou're pulling them into what the characters are doing, and you're making the subtext more\nimportant than the text of the dialogue. These do different things. Generally, I recommend\nerring on doing less with beats, but there are definitely sections where you want to\npull out from the dialogue and actually be talking about the subtext and stuff like that.\nYou'll see some fantastic writers, like Frank Herbert will do this, where it's like, what\nyou're really doing is you're showing the character giving commentary on all the dialogue\nand things people are saying, and the purpose of that scene is more to characterize the\ncharacter who's giving a running commentary, either in their head or to someone else about\nthe dialogue, and the dialogue itself becomes less important than that commentary, because\nthe purpose is to show that this is how this person is.\nAny last questions on dialogue? Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: What are your thoughts about writing\nin caps? BRANDON: Writing in caps? I tend to personally\nfeel that all tools available to a writer are good to use now and then. So I am a fan\nof caps and small caps as both tools to use. I am a fan of em dashes, colons. I think I\ntalked about this last week, right? Semicolons. No, I didn't? OK. I am a big fan of using\nall of the punctuation marks. The only one I don't use is the interrobang, because it\nfeels too comic book to me. I'll show you. I am a big fan of using your three different\ntypes of emphasis, italics, caps, small caps. I guess there's another one. There is both\nof these italicized. I like using-- generally I stick to italicized versus caps, and maybe\nin a caps italicized, as varying levels of emphasis. My emphasis is going to be 90%,\nthat's a weird 9, 90% italics. But I am a big fan of italicizing words to emphasize\nthem in dialogue and in prose, just because it's an extra way to get information to the\nreader in a way that feels like it's showing rather than telling.\nSTUDENT: What about bolding things? BRANDON: Bolding things is generally not done\nvery often in prose fiction in the market right now. Italics and bold mean the same\nthing generally. You can make a distinction, and some writers do. But I would say most\nof the time italics and bold are the same thing, and so they just pick one or the other.\nSTUDENT: For internal dialogue, do you prefer quotes or a different font?\nBRANDON: OK. All right. Direct speech or free indirect speech, these are fancy writer terms\nfor-- there's actually a different one. I'm trying to remember what it's called. But there's\nthree different ways you can convey information in someone's head. One is, \"Oh, no, classes\nare cancelled. What am I going to do?\" he thought. The second way is, \"He heard that\nclasses were going to be cancelled and wasn't sure what to do.\" And then the third way is,\n\"Classes were cancelled. Whatever will I do?\" but not italicized, just left as it is. Generally\nyou're choosing between the first two, italicized thoughts in head or not. My personal style,\nwhich I find very effective, is to use the italicized thoughts as either subject sentence\nor concluding sentence to a section of introspection. We're kind of jumping all over the place,\nbut that's OK, because the questions are. For instance, I would, if a character was\nthinking about classes, they would start with a subject line of, \"'Man, classes have been\ncancelled. What am I going to do?' He had seven classes. They all had tons of homework.\nIt was going to be really troubling, and how was he ever going to get to the dance on time.\nWas the dance going to be cancelled?\" And then anchor it with a coming out of it line\nlike, \"'I guess we'll just deal with it as it comes,' he thought.\" So you're using the\ndirect thought, the direct speech, as a way to funnel into the introspection and out of\nthe introspection. That's my stylistic choice. Different people\nhave very different styles on this, and none of them are really-- no one's going to come\ndown hard on you for picking one or the other. It's just a personal style.\nSTUDENT: When you say, \"he thought,\" are you italicizing?\nBRANDON: I italicize the \"he thought.\" I really,", "1811": " strongly prefer italicized direct thoughts,\nas opposed to nonitalicized direct thoughts. STUDENT: What about a mental dialogue between\ntwo characters? BRANDON: Mental dialogue between two characters\nI will also italicize. Now, you have a lot of different options on this, because some\npeople will small caps those, and that we'll be tagging as this is what small caps means.\nPeople are speaking mentally to each other. Some people will use italics and quotations\nmarks to mean mental dialogue between people. Some people use italics to mean this is happening\nin a different language than the normal language we going in right now. We have shifted. Italics\ncan mean a lot of different things, and you can play with those your own way and how you\nwant them to go. I generally put thoughts with someone else as, \"'Hey, what's going\non with you?' he said.\" But it's in italics with no quote marks. That's a mental projection\nof a thought to someone else in telepathic communication. But lots of different ways\nyou can go on this. STUDENT: In working with publishers and editors,\nare they likely to make you change to their standards, or are they just going to make\nit consistent?", "1874": " BRANDON: My experience, so in working with\npublishers and editors, are they going to make you adhere to their standard, or just\nbe consistent? My experience has been be consistent. I have never had a publisher change any of\nthese sort of things. I've had copy editors do that. But those are the people they send\nthe manuscript to who are going to try and apply a style guide, and you can change that\nstyle guide by saying, \"I use this. Don't change instances of this. I like direct thought.\nDon't take it out.\" Almost no copy editor would do that. But what they do try to is\nthey try to change your use of ellipses sometimes and things like that, if you prefer ellipses.\nWe'll get to all the punctuation marks in", "1921": " a second.\nSTUDENT: Do you think it's better to have thoughts as part of your-- not as an italicized\nsection, but as part of a block of someone narrating almost?\nBRANDON: OK, so narrators. Do I like to have a big block of narrated direct speech inside\nsomeone's head. I do not. That's because I feel like variety is really important, and\nthat I can signpost using it. For instance, if we're doing a big block,\nyou need to do three big paragraphs of introspection. The character's by themself, and there's not\na lot of beats or action here. These happen a lot. I prefer thoughts right here in italics\nto launch us into it, and maybe a summarizing thought right here to keep us focused in the\ncharacter's scene, and then a thought right at the end to summarize what the character's\ncome-- the decision they've made. That just breaks up that big block of text. It's visually\nmore appealing. You do this enough and it starts to get the character-- the reader starts\nto realize these italicized things are summaries or subject lines. If I'm paying attention\nto them, I'm getting bread crumbed through this long section of introspection in a way\nthat starts to make it feel like an internal monologue, but also has more back and forths\nand things like that. Particularly with, like, a lot of times you'll\nsee this one from me. This is, by the way, various how the sausage is made. If you guys\nstart paying attention, this is going to ruin books for you for a little while, but it will\nun-ruin books for you later on. Generally, for a little while, books, you will only see\nhow this stuff works and it'll be really frustrated and annoying to you. But then you kind of\nget over a hump where you are internalizing this, and you're noticing what the author's\ndoing, at the same time as kind of internalizing the tool and paying attention to the story\nseparately, and you can start to do that. It will-- just warning you. But it's not usually\npermanent. Usually this one for me is going to be a contrast\nto where this went. So topic sentence, and then ruminating on it, going a different direction,\nkind of off topic, and they're saying, \"But, no, I can't do that because remember this\nclue we found.\" Circles us back to having to deal with the clue. Character almost is\nhaving an argument with themselves at this point. Flows you through to the end where\nthey've made their decision. \"I'm going to go tell such-and-such about this clue.\" We\nhave now made progress in the scene and there's been motion, and it's been summarized for\nyou at the end. Like I said, how the sausage is made. I hope\nthis does not-- yeah. But start paying attention to how you do this. Use all of these tools\nto-- you want to control the reader's flow through your story. You want to know when\nthings are going to be slower paced for them and introspective and when they're going to\nbe fast. You want to direct the reader's attention in the direction you want it to go. And using\nsome things like this can take this introspection and boost them into the next section where\nthey're going to go have an argument with someone, and you have laid out their entire\nmotivation. They have had a mini argument with themselves. You are coming out of this\nintrospection knowing what their motivation is and what they're going to do next, and\nthen you get to see what they do next as they have the argument with someone else about\nthe things they just talked about through themselves. Establishes motivation.\nAgain, don't lean too hard on this one. But I always say that because I know from experience\nthat most writers are going to do 90% that one, when really it should be probably like\n20% or 30%, depending on your personal style. STUDENT: I read some online books where people\ncan post comments, and I noticed books with", "2140": " a lot of introspection get a lot of criticism\nfrom people because I think people introspect differently.\nBRANDON: Yeah. STUDENT: Or sometimes they criticize how they're\ncoming to this decision. BRANDON: That's true. People introspect differently\nin their own lives. STUDENT: Yeah, and I think it's like opening\nup the machine and showing how it's working, and sometimes people don't like how the machine\nis working, and so they'll criticize that. BRANDON: Sometimes that's true. That is very\ntrue. I would agree with that comment. All right. Let's do the punctuation marks\nreally quickly. Your punctuation mark's job is to help you be more clear to your reader,\nto guide them through complex ideas. All right? Use the punctuation marks to do that. When\nyou're taught grammar in school, it wasn't about this. These things are really useful\ntools. For instance, so punctuation marks are period, comma, em dash, semicolon, colon.\nDid I miss any? Then, you know, the period replacements. These are all tools in your\ntoolbox to use if you want. Oh, by the way, interabang is that one that's\na question mark, exclamative question mark. See it all the time in comics, not very often\nin prose. Some people hate it. Some people love it. Sometimes you will see it actually\nwritten as-- right? The interabang is just a combination of those two things. I don't\nuse the interabang in either of its forms. That's just a thing. Most prose fiction does\nnot use the interabang in either form. You are totally allowed to use the interabang.\nThere is no rule against it. Even if your copy editor tries to cut them all out, you\nare allowed. You are the author. Most of the time, the purpose of your comma\nis going to be to set off thoughts in a way where they all combine together. They're not\nparentheticals, but they are controlling how the reader absorbs your information. This\nis when you have dependent clauses or introductions or conjunctions or things to give the reader\na chance to be like, \"All right, I have to kind of segment this piece of information\nthat's going to relate to this other piece of information,\" and that is really useful\nfor controlling how people read through your books. If you're not using your commas to\nset off ideas like that, your books are going to be really hard to read.\nStudy how writers do it. I can't give you a big grammar lesson here. But generally this\nidea is going to be, like, the purpose of a comma is almost always to be, hang on a\nsec, and now we'll get the rest of it, as opposed to the em dash, which is a parenthetical,\nwhich is an aside. Em dash is when you say, \"I was on my way to get, I had to go get milk.\nOh, and my wife had also said that I should stop by and pick up the kids on the way home--\nwhen I got in a car wreck.\" Like, that's a parenthetical. It's a completely separate,\nindependent idea interjected into the center of another idea.\nYou will also use them when a sentence breaks kind of almost mid-thought and moves to another\nidea. So you kind of are stapling two sentences together in a way that they are disjointed\nfrom each other, where you're trying to indicate that the character is either breaking their\nown thought, or someone else is interrupting them, or something is interrupting them, or\nthey're being kind of, they're jumping around to a lot of different thoughts. Em dash will\nsay to your reader, \"OK, whatever that thing you were doing, were thinking about, this\nis a completely new idea.\" Whereas comma doesn't do that.\nNote that one of the most useful ways to remember if you want a comma is almost always if you're\nrepeating subject and verb you're going to want a comma, because they're independent\nclauses conjoined by a conjunction then. \"I went to the store to buy some milk, and I\nsaw my friend John.\" The reason you put a comma there is because if you don't, and you\nsay, \"I went to the store to buy some milk and I met my friend John,\" until they get\nto the second verb, the reader's going to think they went to buy milk and what else.\nThey went to buy milk and ham? They went to buy milk and bread? But no. You're adding\nan independent clause on the end of that. Put that comma in to indicate to them, \"and\nI also did this other thing.\" OK? I know it's all grammarly. It's annoying stuff. It's really\nuseful to keep your reader-- remember, the whole point is to keep your reader from getting\nconfused. Then semicolon and colon, used less often.\nSemicolon staples together two related ideas that for whatever reason you don't want to\ndo with a conjunction. And colon is usually used for lists, you know how that goes, or\na definition that's coming, where you're going to define a thing for people. You're going\nto set it off. You're like, here's the thing, now the definition of what that thing is.\n\"He had to go get some milk: this blue stuff that he really thought was cool.\" I don't\nknow if that one actually works. But, you know, that's where you're going with colons.\nI may have said comma. I meant colon. All right. That's a complete aside. This is\nstuff that most of you already know, but I'll say it just in case there are those who don't.\nThe whole purpose is to control the reader's flow through the story. And I tell you, if\nyou do not use your commas, particularly when you're separating those independent ideas,\nyou're going to have reader comprehension issues all over the place. All right?\nAll right. Let's move on to description, which", "2496": " we have already mostly covered when we did\nthe pyramid of abstraction, if you remember that conversation. Where did I put my phone?\nOh, my back pocket. But let's ask how you then can use description to make a character\nmore, move up or down on the likeability scale. How can you use your descriptions? Your paragraph\nof description about the setting. STUDENT: You can describe things in funny\nor comical ways. BRANDON: Yes. A character who is humorous\nabout the way to describe their world is naturally going to be more likeable. Yeah, go ahead.\nSTUDENT: What you describe is kind of what the character's thinking about.\nBRANDON: Yeah. What you describe is what they're thinking about.\nSTUDENT: So if they're thinking about positive things, then you write positively about their\nworld. BRANDON: Like, I'm not sure if this is an\nexact one, but kind of these things, like when Matt Cauthon thinks, I'm going to get\nthis quote wrong, but he's like, \"She looks like she could bite iron ingots and spit out\nnails.\" That's his description of what this person looks like. That tells you something\nabout him and abut them. STUDENT: I saw this one book do this really\nwell with everything he described as either sexist or disdainful.\nBRANDON: Yes. Yes, you definitely can do that. Make sure that the reader knows that this\nis the character and not you, which you need to separate by making sure your viewpoints\nare distinctive, or that you're hanging a lantern on it. But yes, very handy. Yeah?\nSTUDENT: So is this description from the point of view character's perspective?\nBRANDON: Yes. STUDENT: What he's seeing and describing?\nBRANDON: Yes.", "2598": " STUDENT: Or is it description of a different\nperson? BRANDON: If you are in third limited or first\nperson, which is going to be 95% of what writers should be writing in today's market, it's\nalways through the perspective of the character doing the describing. So every description\nis going to say something about the character that is doing the describing, and the character\nbeing described. Those are both separate tools. Now, a lot of times, your description will,\nparticularly if you're in third limited and not first person, you're going to veer into\nbeing just a little omniscient for a little while. It doesn't all have to be in the character's\nvoice. Sometimes you just do an economical this is what this thing looks like or this\nperson looks like. In that case, you're moving that dial all the way over toward describing\nthe thing and characterizing it, and less on the character doing the describing. But\nremember that character doing the describing is one of your primary tools of characterization.\nLike, you've only got four ways to characterize people, and I've told you that you want to\navoid the last one as much as is relevant for your writing style. So use those tools.\nHow would you use the description that you're doing to establish a character's motivation?\nYeah.", "2687": " STUDENT: For example, like, if they're in\na desert, then you could describe something as, like, looking like water, but, like, seeing\na mirage. BRANDON: Yeah. Let's say there's a character\nwho wants to go-- oh, go ahead. We'll do yours first.\nSTUDENT: I don't know. I guess it kind of is maybe worth [inaudible], but they see everything\nin context of whatever goal they have. BRANDON: Right.\nSTUDENT: Like, oh, I could use that for this. BRANDON: Yeah, exactly. Just try to imagine\ntwo different characters describing this classroom, one whose main goal is to get A's on every\nclass, and it's working for them, how are they going to describe their classroom, and\nanother whose main goal is to get married. How do you describe the classroom differently\nfor those two characters? This is a tool in your toolbox, your descriptions, and it is\none that writers, new writers particularly, ignore way too often. How can you make a character\nmore proactive through your descriptions? STUDENT: Notices the important things first.\nBRANDON: Notices the important things first. Ranks them. Plans out what they are going\nto do. How can-- oh, go ahead, yeah. STUDENT: All the descriptions are pointed\nout towards the character's goal [inaudible]. BRANDON: How can you-- oh, go ahead.\nSTUDENT: I was just going to say, like, creative dialogue and consistent, like, you know that\ntheir mind is active, even if they are not. BRANDON: How can you make a character express\ntheir flaws through their descriptions? Yeah. STUDENT: I guess the firsts thing that came\nto mind for me is if go with, like, a drug addiction, or something along the lines of\nthat, looking at something and being like, \"Oh, that looks smokable.\"\nBRANDON: Mm-hmm, there you go. There's a great-- if you guys haven't read The Truth by Terry\nPratchett, there's a character who's always looking at things through the eyes of whether\nhe could snort it. He generally thinks he can, and it will give him a buzz, when it's\nnot something that will give him a buzz. The most amusing thing is this character does\nthat. This is also the character who has read a\nwhole bunch of Victorian novels and it's never stated directly, this is how you use dialogue,\nwhere he thinks that this . . .", "2831": " is a swear word, because in Victorian novels\nthey would edit out the curse and they would write it in the book like this. He's read\nthe books enough that he knows that's a swear word, but he doesn't know that the dash replaces\na word. So he says \"ing\" in dialogue all the time, and other characters are like, \"What?\nIng? What?\" It's brilliant. Talk about using dialogue in order to characterize\na character. This is someone who likes to read, but is not good at putting two and two\ntogether. This is a world that has a Victorian sort of sensibility about its literature,\nwhere they are not writing the actual curse words out, and it's characterizing all the\npeople around him who all know all these curses and are really confused by him. It's just\nbrilliant, and it's half a word. Like, talk about a dialogue sequence that does so much\nwhere Pratchett could use half a word to just give you so much. He was a master at all of\nthis. Pratchett's my favorite writer. That's why you hear me gush about him so much.\nAll right, let's move on, because we want", "2916": " to do these other two, and we've covered description\na ton. Let me make sure that there wasn't another bullet point on description. OK. Right.\nAll right. There's a few more things to talk about with description.\nOne thing is establishing shots. This is a screenplay term, or a movie making term, where\noften you will use an establishing shot, the pan across the area the characters are going\nto be in so you get a large scale look at this before you zoom in on the character interactions.\nDescriptive establishing shots can be very handy for a writer as a shorthand. You will\noften see writers start scenes with an establishing shot, which is description. Sometimes they're\nin omniscient. This is Robert Jordan's style. If you haven't\nread The Wheel of Time, every book starts with an establishing shot in omniscient before\nmoving into a character's third limited viewpoint. These establishing shots, generally, if you're\nin third limited, be careful about how you start a scene, because the first name that\na reader sees is the one that they are going to assume you're in that person's head. Not\nalways, but you have to be very careful. So if you're not in someone's head, and you then\nare mentioning someone else, it's going to start to root the reader's idea in that character's\nhead. Often, if you're going to do this establishing\nshot, oftentimes you say, \"Brandon leaned against the little railing thing and looked\nover the room, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" Establishing shot description of what\nthe room looks like. Now we move into the scene. Then once you've done your establishing\nshot, you use anchoring descriptions that are very short descriptions to keep us centered\nin this space, or relative to one another, and to keep us focused in this space. This\nis our pyramid abstraction thing. You use this sometimes as beats, which we're\nkind of moving into here, and sometimes just as pull back for a second, give us another\nsentence of description. \"Brandon has noticed the Expo pen.\" And for some reason it's relevant\nand gives us a description on the Expo pen. That extra bit of description right there\njust will keep us in the scene, rather than-- the danger is white room syndrome, where the\nlonger your characters talk without interacting the setting, the longer your character spends\nin introspection without interacting with the setting, the more danger your reader starts\nto be of imagining that this is all happening in a white room with no actual setting around\nit, and then you're way up on the top of the pyramid abstraction, and when things start\nhappening the reader will be lost where they are in relation to this, where the characters\nare in relation to this. They'll have forgotten the scene.\nRemember description has to it more than one sense. There are five senses, depending on\nwho you talk to. You're going to over-rely", "3096": " on sight. Almost all authors do. You are going\nto under-rely on sound, and you're going to under-rely on scent. Taste is the hard one.\nYou're going to under-rely on touch. Oftentimes, a great establishing shot in writing prose\nversus anything, is that you can tell us what temperature it is and how the character feels\nabout that temperature. You can get us key sense that no film can really get across in\nthe same way and play to your advantage the fact that we can use multiple senses when\nfilms have to evoke other senses through using sight or sound. Understand that these are\ntools of yours and they are great at the beginning of setting a scene. All right?\nOK, let's move to beats and action. I just", "3156": " explained to you the advantage we have over\nvisual mediums like cinema. We have a big disadvantage at the same time, and that is\nthat cinema being a visual medium with a strong secondary audio component means that they\ncan set a scene real fast and you will, if the filmmaker's doing their job right, never\nlose track of where the character is in relation to everything else around them, unless the\nfilmmaker wants you to. The reader of your book is going to struggle\nto place your characters into the setting. This is going to be a constant back and forth\nbetween you and them as you don't want it to become white room syndrome, and you don't\nwant to overly laden them with too many blas\u00e9 descriptions of people walking around in the\nspace. But at the same time, if you're going to have action in particular, the reader needs\nto be able to place all the important components into the scene.\nSo action sequences are a little harder for novelists to do than films are. The films,\nlet's just say they get an extra little boost from being a visual medium to action sequences.\nEverything is slightly more exciting on film than it would be on the paper naturally when\nit comes to quick things like an action beat. You can counter this by using the advantages\nthat you have that cinema does not, which are specifically, more than two senses, but\nalso you are inside a character's head. So you can treat an action sequence, and I would\nrecommend that you treat action sequences, and introspection, and dialogue, less description,\nbut you can treat them all as mini arcs, as we talked about in plotting.\nFor instance, if you're having an action sequence, one of the best things to do is to start off\nwith showing character motivation, then you", "3281": " hopefully have established this before the\naction sequence starts. Then you can show the character making a plan. It doesn't have\nto be an active \"I'm going to have a plan now.\" But you can set up what the promise\nis. The character can see, \"All right, there's 10 of them in this room.\" You can give us\nan indication of what the progress is then going to be. \"There's 10 bad guys. I win when\nthey're all dead. We're going to count them.\" Right? Because you can show the character\ngoing through and giving a sense of progress to an action sequence by even, you'll see\nme doing this, counting off how many they've defeated to get to the end. Now that's not\nthe only way to do it, and don't rely too much on any one tool.\nBut you can also have your plan be, \"I need to get to the end of this hallway.\" That is\nyour stated objective for the character. The progress is them fighting their way through\nthe hallway, taking cover here, going here. In this case, you don't count the enemies,\nbecause your progress is not how many enemies do I defeat, your progress is do I reach--\nyou're basically writing a fighting travelogue in this case. Do I reach the place that I\nneed to get to? And then what is the payoff? You can do in action scenes little mini versions\nof each of these things. The character's like-- if it's-- how about this? There's a great\nscene where, in The Emperor's New Groove, there's a short action sequence where Kronk\ncuts a rope and drops a chandelier on Izma. And it all plays out in this way. Most of\nthem you will. This is a big strong character who's goofy and funny and sympathetic antagonist,\nversus the very unsympathetic antagonist who has been his boss for the whole thing. You\nhave character motivation set up all the way through where Kronk is thinking, he has shoulder\nangel and things like that, and you have all this motivation established that his motivation\nis \"I need to-- we're done.\" Then she insults his food, his spinach puffs. You have his\nplan. STUDENT: From above, kind of evil receives\ntheir just reward. BRANDON: Yes. The plan is \"you're going down.\"\nThe progress is his shoulder angel points at the ceiling. Or he points at the ceiling\nand they say that. Then you have your payoff where he cuts it. And because it's a comedy,\nwhat happens? She goes right through the middle. STUDENT: [inaudible]\nBRANDON: It's strange that usually works. This is all a little sequence of an action\nsequence that is done. You can go-- but most action sequences you will read in books that\nwork, and in movies, will have some variation of this. You've established a character motivation.\nYou show them come up with something they want to do. You show-- you lead the reader\nto the points of progress and then the payoff, which is success or failure. Run your action\nsequences that way, and you will have a lot more success than if it's like, action sequence\nhappens now, they fight for a while, and then we're done. Those action sequences are going\nto be boring, and you want to avoid them as much as possible, and you want to have this\nas much as possible. STUDENT: How do you do a sense of progress\nin, say you have, like, two characters fighting,", "3499": " and you as an audience don't know which character\nis going to win, so there isn't, like, a sense of progress because they're just fighting\nuntil one of them slips up and the other wins and gets the upper hand. Like, how do you\nwrite that? BRANDON: Great question. How do you write\ntwo characters in a fight? How do you express a sense of progress to this fight and you're\nnot sure who is stronger than the other? STUDENT: In one of my writing pieces, I have\ntwo characters that are just physically separated, and as they move and attack each other they\njust get closer and closer. BRANDON: That's true. That's a great way to\ndo it, if you're fighting at range and they're moving to closer and closer.\nSTUDENT: You can show a back and forth and small victories really easy there.\nBRANDON: Back and forth and small victories are very, very key there. Changes in the status\nquo. Like, what this didn't include is changes in the status quo. A lot of times you do this\nprogress and the status quo changes. A lot of times, you have a great action sequence\nwhere Jackie Chan needs to fight all these dudes with a ladder. And then what happens\nat the end? A bunch more dudes come in. So then Jackie's like, \"OK, new plan. I give\nup.\" Go ahead. STUDENT: I'd say the addition of injuries,\nbut also how tired they become. BRANDON: Yeah, addition of injuries, how tired\nthey become. These are all things like-- writing your fight sequence between two characters,\nto ask yourself, what are my surprises, like I would in a regular plot? What are my twists\nand turns? What are the issues we're going to get into where we have a narrative turn,\nor we discover new information? They've gotten out a chair from underneath the thing. Wrestling\ntends to be really good at this, the one on one that has back and forths that you can\nuse to strip fight sequences. they tend to be very good at it.\nSTUDENT: How do you describe fighting sequences about somethings your reader might not know\nabout? They might not know the punches and kicks.\nBRANDON: OK. How do you describe the tactical punches and kicks in a way that is going to\nwork for the reader that doesn't know all this? You've got a couple tools. One is to\nteach them through the course of the story so that they're an expert in that jargon by\nthe time it's relevant. Another way is to abstract it some way or summarize it some\nway. Robert Jordan would have these forms, it's like boar rushes down the hill is a way\nof using the sword. You don't need to necessarily imagine exactly what Rand is doing when he\ndoes boar rushes down the hill, because you're like, OK, I see what's going on here. It's\na momentum. I can imagine the boar going down the hill. And then he'll use that tag to explain\nit in the future and things like that. You can use it like dialect. This character's\nusing dialect, but we're going to make sure there are summaries periodically so that you\nknow what's happening as the reader, even if you don't know all of these things. You\ncan have commentary going on at the same time that is working that for you. There's lots\nof different approaches you can do, depending on the style of story you're writing.\nThat said, subgenre can help with this. For instance, if you're writing a regency romance,\nthere are certain things you can expect that your reader will pick up on or will just pick\nup through context that you do not have to explain, because it's part of the genre. If\nyou're writing science fiction you say, \"They went to FTL between planets.\" You don't necessarily\nhave to set up how the FTL works if your story's not about that, and your reader will accept,\n\"All right, they went between planets. I don't even know what FTL means, but maybe I should\nknow.\" STUDENT: Faster than light.\nBRANDON: Yeah, it means faster than light. Yep, go ahead.\nSTUDENT: How do you-- coming at that from a different angle, if your reader is, for\nexample, well versed in martial arts, how do you describe fight scenes using martial\narts without breaking immersion where you're not an expert?\nBRANDON: Right. How do you approach these things when you're not an expert and some\nof your readership might be? You have a lot of information at your fingertips\non the internet. You have a lot of primary sources on the internet, and you have a lot\nof people doing really great, useful things to help you learn about whatever it is you\nneed to learn about. For instance, I use Matt Easton's channel on YouTube where he will\noften record bouts of \"this is a person with a spear versus a person with a knife. We're\ngoing to run it 20 times and you can see how it plays out.\" Very handy for someone who\nhas never fought a knife against a spear. You have the advantage that you can get--\nyou can learn a bunch about a topic very quickly and get yourself up to, I'm making up these\nnumbers, you can get 50% of the way to an expert on something with a minimal amount\nof research. And then that next 50% takes nine more years. So my recommendation to you\nas a writer is to get yourself to 50% on as many of these things as you can that are going\nto be relevant to you, and then find experts to fix the little things you get wrong.\nI generally hire subject experts on things. For instance, Kaladin's field medicine. For\nthe first book I hired a field surgeon who had medical training in the military, who\nhad been in these situations, to go over all of the things I was doing and say if I did\nit right or wrong and to give me little hints here and there. I've found that if you get\nyourself most of the way there, that easy part, then you will not make the big mistakes.\nYou will make small mistakes that somebody can tweak for you. It's not 100%.\nIn Skyward I made some big mistakes, even though I didn't realize it. But fortunately,\nI had three fighter pilots read my book, and they very quickly disabused me of the big\nthings that I had gotten wrong, and it did require a more extensive rewrite then. But,\nyeah, those experts, people who are passionate about things generally look forward to the\nopportunities to be passionate about it in a way that's going to make your story better.\nSo find those people and make use of them. Go ahead.\nSTUDENT: Just out of curiosity, what were the Skyward mistakes?\nBRANDON: Skyward mistakes was mostly about how it feels to feel G forces in different\ndirections and what it did to you. I was not writing that G force this direction versus\nthis direction versus this direction. I was not separating the three different ways those\nwould feel. Or that direction, I guess there's four basic ways. They were all jumbled together\nin the original draft and I was not accurate on how those different things felt and the\ndifferences they had on your body as you were being pulled the different directions. I had\nworked on the instinct that G force makes you go unconscious. But it only makes you\ngo unconscious if the G force is in the direction that's going to draw blood from your brain\nsomewhere else. It's more dangerous to have blood go into your eyes and do visual damage\nto you than it is to go unconscious. STUDENT: Oh, thank you for that.\nBRANDON: Yes, I'm sorry about that image in your head. Yeah, go ahead.\nSTUDENT: Did the gyroscopic cockpit exist before this conversation.\nBRANDON: The gyroscopic did not exist before this conversation in Skyward. The point of\nthat was me realizing I was exerting G forces in the wrong directions for what people could\nactually tolerate, and I needed some sort of system that would help with that. That\nwas why it was it was a bigger rewrite. We don't have a ton more time there, so let\nme just make sure that I've got everything that we were going to talk about on action.\nLet's see. Oh! We won't go over this one long, but let me\nask the same question for you. Think about it in your head. How can you use an action\nsequence and beats to make a character more likeable? How can you use it to establish\nmotivation? How can you show someone being proactive? How can you show their flaws? How\ncan you-- whatever the fifth one is? Show how competent they are? That one's pretty\neasy in action sequences, or incompetent. You're going to look to use these five things\nin all of these things. We're going to end with naval gazing. You\ndon't need a lot of explanation how to do naval gazing, because you all probably are\ndoing it way too much already. You're probably experts at naval gazing and having your characters\nruminate on their problems for multiple pages. STUDENT: In life or in writing?\nBRANDON: Yeah, in both real life and writing. Some recommendations for your naval gazing.\nTry to break it up. Try to use the other things. And try to find some way-- if you're not going\nto use the direct thought versus free and direct thought thing like I do, figure out\nhow you're going to make sure that there is a point to this period of naval gazing, and\nthat the reader can have a strong, solid takeaway from it that something's been accomplished.\nMake your naval gazing do those five things. Make sure you're not accidentally just not\ndoing any of those in this one where it should be very natural for you to be doing that.\nbut make sure that the naval gazing is causing your reader to strengthen their motivation\nor change their motivation. Make sure that the naval gazing is establishing for them\ntheir flaws and their becoming aware of them. A lot of your naval gazing is going to be\nreinforcing your character arc. For your character arcs, just a few things\nto keep in mind. At some point, most arcs involve a reassessing of goals. This generally\nis your character's want versus need sort of thing, where they're coming to understand\nthe need and giving up the want. Not always, but a lot of your character arcs are going\nto do that. In fact, a lot of your character arcs are going to follow a little bit of three-act\nstructure on their own, because a lot of your character arcs are going to have a point where\nyour character has established their flaw, theoretically through all of these things,\nwithout really noticing it. There's going to be a point where they change from inactive\nabout their character flaw, to being active working on their character flaw. Just like\nyou often have the transition between Act I and Act II, between the character being\nacted upon and taking action. That doesn't always happen at that point.\nBut at some point, most flaws that's going to be the case. Sometimes you have an entire\nbook where the character does not acknowledge their flaw until the end, and the end of book\none is the character saying, \"I really need to work on this thing. This is serious. This\nis a big deal.\" Then you're going to, in the next book, show them actually working on it.\nBut at some point they should move from inactive to active regarding their flaw. Not all stories\nfollow this format, but just kind of giving you a few rules of thumb.\nA lot of times your character is going to have a relapse on their flaw, which is going\nto be kind of parallel to the darkest moment in the plot, the all is lost moment, where\nyour character thought they had it, but then they slip up, and it looks really bad because\nthey have slipped up. But there's still something left for them to learn to pick up and move\nforward. A lot of times in your character arc, you're going to have a moment where the\ncharacter's internal conflict aligns in some way with the external conflict. This can be\nan overlapping, where the character finally gives up their wants and realizes that their\nneed is the thing that is going to accomplish the plot. It can be a contrast, where the\ncharacter realizes that they're going to have to lapse further into this dangerous territory\nwith their flaw in order to accomplish what the plot needs them to do. This is kind of\nmore of the tragedy sort of thing. This is where the serial killer character who doesn't\nwant to be a serial killer anymore realizes that he needs to kill this demon. Dan Wells.\nWhere you're having that moment where the character has to give up something they really\nwant and backslide. You can do all sorts of these different things, but at some point\nthose two need to intersect, external and internal motivation need to intersect. Almost\nall plots, that's going to be a very vital and important moment for you.\nThat's all the time we have for character. We will do Q&A on these two weeks of characters,\nso please do fill out your thing. Remember that we have put over here, the writing advice\nsection, we have on there, we have the Skyward outline and the first two chapters done differently\nthat I threw away before I settled on the third one, so you can see actively me doing\nthis. Next week we'll meet online, and I will answer your questions from this week and last\nweek.

"60": " readers connect with a character who has a tragic past without making them too incompetent or annoying this is actually a really great question so couple pieces of advice here now if it's tragic backstory the thing you generally want to avoid is having the character themselves ruminate on it too much now we talked about introspection navel-gazing you will do some of this good suggestion is often to have something remind the character of the thing they've lost and then have them have a spike of pain and move beyond it people who move beyond their pain are going to be innately more sympathetic than people who ruminate on it this is difficult because it's very natural for a person to actually think about their pain and we don't want to minimalize the pain or the tragedy that people go through at the same time just having people be one note and focus on all the time it's gonna make people annoyed so multiple notes have them have multiple emotional reactions try to have them not be moan their situation too much and maybe have other people moan it show them trying hard to succeed and failing anyway particularly through reasons outside there can trol and you will be able to build that sympathy for a character who is failing or who has lots of tragedy in their life if you're worried something I should mention here is that there is a there's a what do you call it there's a trope called women and for refrigerators so that I would recommend you read it's a there is a theme and storytelling where a person uses a character who is not a lot of influence or power of the story usually a the girlfriend of a superhero which is where this trope origin originated so read about the whole women in refrigerators trope it is a troubling theme that writers tend to take people with no autonomy over the story and kill them as a way of building sympathy for the character who does have autonomy over the story and what this tends to do is treat a lot of characters particularly women in the stories as having no control over their lives and treating them as objects who exist only to further the motivations of the protagonist this is dangerous trope to fall into because it leads you into all kinds of difficult situations where you are both making your characters not feel risk realistic you were removing autonomy from a large number of your characters and you're falling into a cliched trope at the same time you do want your protagonists to care about the people in their lives who are generally if you're writing fantasy science fiction typing is going to have less power over their situation so it's not an easy never kill people in your books but it's also a be careful when you're doing this to make sure that they are full and developed characters who have autonomy in their lives and ask yourself if you're falling into the tropes a little too much what comes first the characters the plot what generally changes more during the writing process I would say for me it's it's about even my and but characters do change more during the writing process they change the plot rather than the plot changing the characters for me

these stories out of my head onto the page let people experience the things that I have dreamed and imagined what makes me work every day like my small-scale motivation my daily motivation is watching

who and it doesn't even have a line of dialogue if this person is presented very accurately I remember for instance that in the comic books again in the death of Superman storylines after Superman died back in the 90s there are a lot of people who tried to take up his mantle and the one I remember the most is the one who had the least screen time it was a guy who had a hotdog cart and started giving away free hotdogs while wearing a Superman shirt he's like this is how I'm going to be Superman and that's you know that just stuck with me right that's a character who I think had like three panels or something like that maybe I'm remembering wrong but doing something very brief to add a lot of rooting interest for a character can make a secondary character very powerful to us in a very short amount of time what does", "497": " it mean exactly when you say add a viewpoint this is in context of the I believe where I was saying if you need to lengthen your story you add a viewpoint what I mean by this is a viewpoint character generally in a book the number of viewpoint characters you have is going to greatly influence how long your story is a viewpoint character is a character with your whose eyes we see in a first-person story this is going to be the eye you can have multiple eyes in a story in a third limited which is what I generally spend more of my time writing this is just someone else's head that you're in now I'll make the caveat here that occasionally writers myself included liked to jump to one person's viewpoint for a short period of time one chapter and you're not gonna get a lot of characters are a lot of viewpoints through their eyes usually this is to add flavor to the world or to show a plot point you can't normally show or to just show a scene from someone else's perspective while all the other characters are there just so you can do something new with it but each time you get through someone's into someone's eyes you're going to have to start establishing rooting interest or sympathy or you know antipathy if your antipathy I'm sure how to say that word you're going to want to establish this character in the readers eyes and that's going to take some extra words then using a character you've already used you have to establish the way that they think about the word world which is going to use extra words and if you actually want a this to be a solid viewpoint character you're gonna want to create an arc for them either an internal arc or an external arc or multiples of each and you're gonna want to have a sequence of viewpoints that shows them working toward their goals or in otherwise changing which just adds another parallel dimension to your story you can imagine this if you were watching a movie that was about teenagers going to school and about a young woman who is trying to join a sports team and her arc is this whole get in on to the sports team get on to the soccer team how that would be a story if you are going to add a viewpoint you perhaps add the coach's viewpoint and you're showing the coach's home life and all the things that are going on in her life and how things are difficult for her and how you know all of this and suddenly you've got a second storyline but then meets the dovetail into the first storyline in some way by the ending to make it feel cohesive and you can see that that just adds a lot of extra work but also it adds a lot of extra depth and changes your story dramatically now if instead of showing the coach's story you were showing the team captains story and this team captain has a different story it changes your book in a different direction so adding viewpoints is one of the ways that you sculpt the story and the way you're doing it how do I character development happening at a steady rate instead of too much at once are not fast enough this is practicing with your beta readers in your alpha readers this is not one of those things that I can give you a formula for very easily but this is one where you're going to just have to just can have to look at it you're gonna have to try it you're gonna have to see what works for you generally you're gonna want every scene with that character to either keep establishing you know their motivations or to show them changing in some way ideally every scene shows something like this they make a step forward or backward both in their emotional plot their internal plot in their relationships or their external plot in some way and also is helping ground their motivation even further and doing that in every scene if you can and watch what readers say watch what T readers talk about this is where your pacing comes in how quickly are you moving us through the progress toward your promise is what pacing means or at least one of the definitions of pacing how do you write characters that have mental illnesses that you don't know much about you come to know about them I highly recommend for topics such as this", "748": " that so what our top is just this these are topics that if you do them poorly and you your book you can it you can do damage to a group of people for instance by in accurately representing mental health issues you can in your book help to isolate people you can make people feel worse or you can sway the public opinion in ways that are harmful because of this this is one of those issues that you should be really careful about I don't think you should avoid doing it this is where maybe I difference different opinion from some others who have legitimate suggestions that you just right about things that you don't have personal experience in for me writing is about exploring the world in the human condition and for me to do that in a way that is anyway satisfying to me I have to have every character explore being something or someone different from how I am and this is just part of my my writing foundation and so because of that I'm gonna get some things wrong and you're gonna get some things wrong and you are going to accidentally do damage so be aware of that do your best to avoid it by doing your research going to primary sources and asking them reading their blogs reading their biographies reading about them the things that they write about their life in any of these sort of situations and then make sure you get some people from that group to read your story pay them if they are an expert's or in other ways try to get people to read your stories and give you feedback so that you can know this is just something I feel that if you're going to approach these issues you take upon yourself as a burden as a writer that is part of your responsibility how do you keep character voices different", "874": " from each other how do you make distinct characters we talked a lot about this last week and so I'm not sure if we need to delve into this again but I would say that remember motivations mixed with characters background influencing their view of the world mixed with their their individual voice their personality coming through in the way they describe the world that's gonna get work but last week's lecture covered this and this is a question from two weeks ago so let's see oh here's a great question how do", "915": " you kill characters so it's kind of an interesting thing for me because I often take a little more of a philosophical approach to this one a lot of writers you'll talk to they say my characters my characters and I just let them do what they're doing and when I first started writing I thought this was complete luck I'm like now the characters do what I write for them to do I'm a novelist this is what I do but at the same time I can understand that particularly in characters taking great risks I as a writer kind of view it as I am going to not withhold the consequences some of the times sometimes I will of characters taking actions that could cause their deaths and I feel like when a character death is a direct consequence of actions taken by them or other characters in the story it is going to come across it's going to work lots of times in life stories our deaths are not direct consequences they're often indirect consequences and stories those tend to be very unsatisfying when you have a giant war epic and your protagonist general dies of dysentery on the battlefield it's a very difficult story to write in a way that's going to be satisfying that's challenge if you want to do it but most of the time that character dying as a result of the decision they made to have a battlefield in a certain place or as a decision another character made to betray that character or something like this is going to be a more satisfying story to tell because that's how we do storytelling now you're going to have to decide how you want this death to work what are you wanting the death to achieve so it's a very different thing if a character fulfills their arc and in fulfilling their arc decides to take a risk or make a sacrifice and die because of that that's a very different story that's a very heroic story it's a very kind of classical Hollywood story a different sort of story is the character is about to complete their arc and die right before it this is hugely unsatisfying which is something you can use as a tool in your storytelling I have done it before George Martin is very very good at this this idea of leaving you hanging in a way that all of the character are left hanging because they thought this characters Ark should be completed and it didn't get completed this is a very dangerous tool to use readers do not like running across this very often unless you've already established that this is a theme of your story and it becomes a plus instead of a minus how else do you kill characters making it a direct consequence of the actions of the antagonists is always a great idea if you are going to be killing characters in your story there are a lot of great ways to do this however you need to ask yourself what result do I want to have why is this character death happening in my story how can I make sure that it is not feeling tropi but it's feeling like the real death of a character that and understand this is going to have real consequences and on reader emotions and how what do I want it to do as a story piece that is a difficult balance to walk because on one hand I'm telling you make sure it doesn't feel like the author just playing with figures on a table and knocking one over and this and while on the other hand I'm telling you you are an author playing with figures on the table and deciding to knock one over it's about the illusion it's the illusion of this is all real don't let them see the author's hand when they see the author's hand then you have generally made a mistake software I use to keep everything straight all right", "1154": " so software I used to keep everything straight is wicked pad which is an open-source wiki software which I recommend if you want to keep a wiki for yourself there's you know moderate documentation about it I was able to figure it out and I am not terribly techy so I assume that you can figure it out as well I use Microsoft Word for everything else and I keep it on Dropbox those are really my tools I generally mean nothing else I have not used Scrivener extensively a lot of people swear by it and there are people I trust so I think it is probably a very good tool but I have never used it so how do", "1194": " I know when my character is too competent with 7os so character competence becomes a problem when things are supposed to be difficult for that character and they aren't now things not being difficult for the character doesn't have to be a problem is the thing this comes down to the tone of your story and what people are wanting to get out of your story for instance having a story that is a mystery where the detective is extremely competent and the fun of the story is watching the character the detective step through the discovery process is really fun this is Sherlock Holmes right why was Sherlock Holmes loved by everyone shock Holmes was incredibly competent and you just got to watch him solve a problem through the course of that story now if the story were more about Sherlock Holmes as a character as a lot of the modern adaptations are then these stories tend to focus on the areas of incompetence that Sherlock Holmes has while balancing it with competence so for instance if Sherlock Holmes were also emotionally very stable and great at relationships and had everything together in his life then the modern adaptations would not be as interesting because they're expanding to other areas they're not just about can he solved this mystery modern adaptations tend to be about can he solved this mystery while maintaining a relationship with Watson while his own life is falling apart because he's a sociopath right or something like that in this case competence in one area is balanced by incompetence in another if your character is competent in all areas you can still have a story that's engaging it's just a very different type of story it's gonna be we're gonna enjoy watching the character go through the motions we are not going to connect or empathize with that character generally as much but this can still work you just have to decide what type of story you're telling in general most writers myself included would recommend balancing areas of competence with areas of incompetence to give yourself more tools to tell a more varied story but it is not the only way to tell stories Adam do you have any questions for me all right how do you make a an iconic", "1335": " villain terrifying instead of cliche so um anytime so how about this a cliche is when a story is doing something that it's done it's been done so many times that the original purpose of the cliche has been lost and replaced with kind of the pop understanding the collective understanding of it for instance the original purpose of a villain giving a monologue at the end of their story is to fill the reader in on details now when a caret-- villain does that a significant portion of the audience says oh they're monologuing again that reminds me of that other story where they make jokes about that isn't that funny and instead of paying attention to getting the information the readers are instead remembering another story in getting the wrong mood applied to your story that's why a villain monologue is generally a bad idea now now of course it was probably always a bit of a bad idea but it's especially a bad idea because of the cliche so if you're asking how do I prevent a villain from being cliche this becomes you asking yourself all right what has the cliche been replaced with what was the original intent what is now what's going on but if the villain is cliched because a lot of villains these days you would say why are they cliched it is because they are OneNote they want", "1438": " only one thing they don't have a lot of time in the film you're watching for this villain to have multiple you know character traits so they focus on the one they want some MacGuffin whether it be a mother box or an infinity stone and they are spending all of their time getting this thing and don't really explain why they wanted except for nebulous power this is generally the most cliched type of villain that's pretty easy to undermine or to subvert by spending a little bit of time giving the villain interesting motivations for this thing spending all this work that we've talked about building characters devote it to your villain it's going to take more time taking more time and more screen time on the page can be difficult particularly if you don't have a viewpoint for your villain but this these are the sorts of things that you want to practice if you want to stop being cliche and it's in valence is particularly difficult because of a couple things one is screen time if you are not writing a lot of viewpoints from that character's eyes it's going to be harder to give them motivations but it's not impossible particularly if you have your main one of your main characters spending a lot of time with this villain and you present one motivation and then you add complexity to it with you for future scenes readers really like this I as a reader love this when I'm presented as a villain that says I need the MacGuffin and you're like oh great this is what the villain does and then the next scene they are I need the MacGuffin because my family is being held and I can use it to get my family back mmm suddenly more motivation and the further you go with that villain the more of course I did pick the most cliched way to give depth to a villain but you see what I'm talking about here more time more diversity of this characters perspectives and opinions and foundation of their motivation is just gonna serve you very well in this regard you make a villain not cliche in the same way you make any character not cliche all right I'm gonna jump some of", "1568": " the questions from last week let's see these are not formatted quite as well so okay let me do a few of these and then how do I make two characters who have opposing goals equally sympathetic especially when one of them is clearly on the road to villainy so we talked a little about this right now I want to dig into this idea just a little bit more and say putting them at contrasting goals is really really handy this is a just a great way to make a villain but you do ask the question of how can you make them both sympathetic they should both want what they're going for and make the achieving of it mutually exclusive meaning if one gets it's a zero-sum the other one can't get it and then you just show why they both want it right if you show their motivations if you should let us see why they need this thing then it will work for itself it'll work itself out if we have we understand their motivations and their motivations are sympathetic motivations meaning their motivations that a normal person would have one of the reasons that villains get cliched is this sort of I want power which is kind of nebulous like yes people want power but really in our lives what we want is I want this promotion so that I the work I'm doing I'm respected for yes getting promotion does give you more power but how then there seem to be very few people are just like oh ah I want power the more they're along the lines of I could do this job so well if I just could cut through the red tape if I can get to a higher level then get this promotion the red tape goes away and I can make it done the way I want it to be done and that would be great because everything will run more smoothly that is a realistic motivation as opposed to I want the promotion for more power and you know spend a little bit of time and ask yourself why a person would want to do this and you know two characters going for the same promotion one of them wants it because they feel like they can legitimately just make the world a better place and the other one wants it because they're there you know they need an expensive type of surgery that if they can't pay for they will die you have two contrasting motivations only one of them can have the promotion obviously there are ways around this but you see what I'm doing suddenly we're sympathetic for both but there's one that we want to succeed a little bit more this is how you go about things let's see", "1728": " how do you know which metaphors are appropriate when you're writing about a fantasy world that shares elements shares many elements of the real world oh you've got a problem ahead of you here well it's a problem in that I can offer you solutions but you're gonna have to make some difficult decisions this is the translation problem is what we call it basically you're asking when readers are reading my book and you'll have your character put their feet up on an ottoman do you call it an ottoman when the Ottoman Empire never existed in this fantasy world even though the fantasy world is very similar to earth in a lot of other ways you ask yourself can you say it is the straw that broke the camel's back without people saying wait a minute that's a saying in our world I know they have straw and camels in this world but they really come up with the exact same metaphor it's even worse if there aren't camels or you haven't introduced in that and you're like they're like wait wait wait they're camels in this world I guess there must be but that's just very very weird to me you have all kinds you can go down a rabbit hole in this for instance in Miss Warner I use a lot of Greek and Latin word derivations in order to create the fantasy words that I'm using for the names of the magic systems because in our world we use a lot of Greek and Latin so you end up with something like allomancy which you know Mansi means to see the future it also is a thing that sounds like a fantasy magic and so when I use the word allomancy am I saying that Latin exists in this world and that elements actually means what the Latin means or I might it you can go down a rabbit hole you'll have to make your own decisions here on what you decide to do I use something that Tolkien said and I'm paraphrasing him horribly but basically the idea was the books are translations from an original tongue and the translator has interpreted sayings into things that a modern Western audience reading in English would understand and so if Bill happens to say something that you're like wait a minute wait a minute there's no Ottoman Empire that is just the translator who is translated it into English and therefore using the word that is most similar this is what I usually use as my excuse for this it's being translated English and the translator is Brandon Sanderson and he is going to use some terms from our world now and then but even in saying that you have to be careful particularly in a fantasy work with how much you kick the reader out yes they can go through the thought process of that the one that is kicked people out of the books the most is when I used the term homicidal hat-trick for a character who had killed three members of another characters family and I just love the term so much I put it in even though my editors like this will kick people out and I'm like yeah but I like it and then indeed it is probably the phrase that has kicked people out the most because they sitting they think all right hat-trick means this it's a sports term do they have sports on this world what are they doing where they come up with this that sort of thing it is been you know it's one of those things that even if you're in the right right there is no right it's a fantasy novel right but even if you're in the right there can be the question of if you kick your audience out or a significant portion great you're right your story still works worse than if you were wrong and so sometimes it's better just to trim these things out but you're gonna have to make that call yourself Adam let's get a question from the audience right", "1958": " right character for the right plot in the early stages of developing a story hmm boy I do a lot of this on instinct I'll try to break it down for you generally I am doing in the early parts of my writing some free rights from the character's viewpoints sometimes these end up in the book sometimes they don't I posted for you the beginning of skyward where I did three different introductions to this character and the this was me searching to make sure I had the right character for this plot almost always as a writer you can make any plot interesting with any character with skill it is very rare that I sit down and after writing for awhile say man this is the wrong character for this plot because if you're doing your job right then the plot is often catching people who are not well suited to the story that they're in and forcing them to go on the adventure anyway that's what a lot of stories are about you are a fish out of water you are the person who has to save the world but you don't fit that narrative and as you write who the character is will influence how they decide to go through this story and if you're doing your characterization right the reader will be like yeah this totally feels like how this character would go about saving the world and that back and forth is what makes writing stories really fun and engaging so I would worry about this less than you probably are considering you're asking a question about it that said once in a while a character doesn't fit they are the wrong character this happens when a character for instance is distracting from another plot they are so usually it's somebody who's very curious right like their plot is super interesting but it doesn't align with the main plot and you bring them into the story and suddenly every reader wants to read about this character instead and they're not focusing on your main story that's when you have decision points we're like maybe this character should Bend the hero from the beginning or maybe this character needs their own story and I need to put someone in that that role who better folds into the group dynamic that I am creating for this ensemble cast that definitely does happen now and then but it's almost never do I think oh the character is the wrong character for the plot the most I've ever done is do what I did in way of Kings where I split a character in half and made two different characters out of them Dallin are in a delenn as I've talked about before so that that could split apart the motivations for the characters and the goals of the characters and have them in conflict with each other instead of the calm like internal in one character so let me take another one of these these are yeah", "2138": " this is not this is this is harder because my ITA didn't have time to get to it this time so it's harder for me too all right can you give us advice on how to submit to a publisher basically normally I get all the questions separated from all the I likes and now they're all together in one form so scam just scroll through but this will be next week next week we will do a big rundown of all the publishers and science fiction and fantasy and some of the table sure's and childrens we will talk about how to submit to them and we will talk about publishing in traditional publishing sense theoretically the next week we will do some brief indie publishing sort of things I have some some students in the class who are successful full time independent writers and they've given me some notes we were gonna have them talk to you but this whole format we're gonna use their notes instead and I'm going to share some of those things with you and some of my own because I have done some indie publishing so next week we will dig into it the big publishing lectures and those are Sur firehose lectures so I'm sorry about that let's see this every conversation need to be an info DUP that's strictly centered around the plot ah that's a good question and the answer is obviously no you're asking for me the right place every conversation should do something hopefully every conversation does multiple things that does not mean that they have to be an info dump which is one of the things that conversations do or advancing the plot there are lots of other things that conversations do for instance some conversations and", "2246": " books exist solely to show that these two characters have a background together this is when you have the character meet another character and they share a joke about Budapest right this happened in the it happens in the Marvel films you're like these characters have banter they have a history they know each other and are friendly to each other and go it can be also conflict driven where these characters have not gotten along in the past dialogue can achieve that dialogue can be there just to make the reader laugh or to make the reader cry to inspire an emotion in the character a lot of of characterization or a lot of dialogue in films is there to just be a joke now this is often doing multiple things it's making the reader laugh it's often advancing the relationship of the characters and it is often providing a break in the pacing of a you know tight action sequence or some other thing to give you a chance to feel another emotion for a while because one of the things you want to avoid in your stories generally is you you want to avoid always being at at end this is this can be a big problem I suppose I can write because we did all this stuff on the board if your story is always like this is your characters emotional graph right and this is time and this is how emotional they are on this topic and your story is like this this character is angry and they are always at attendent this is going to have it's gonna be bad for your story this is going to lead to that OneNote character problem that we talked about a couple of weeks ago it's going to lead to the reader feeling fatigued about this character and about the high emotions that are happening in it you are also going to feel the story is stagnating because there is no motion now of course if this character is having a time where something makes them a little angry but then they get over it but then something worse happens and they try to get over it but then spikes up and then this is where you know Hulk smash your story has motion your story has ups and downs your story is going to work better this is the same sort of thing with action if your story is at a 10 for action the entire time you're going to have fatigue in fact it generally is even the same way for tension and pacing now on pacing wise I will say that I have read shorter books that keep the pacing at a 9 or a 10 the entire book and it works for me because I read it in one sitting and then I'm done and then I'm like that was a page-turner those books if they ever get long enough that I have to put them down at the end of it I feel unsatisfied because I've been at a 10 or a 9 the whole time for you know characters this happens a lot in thrillers put it down come back and like how it's still at a 10 right this is getting old this is just not working so that's a matter of length of story I often feel like I can keep the pacing as a writer faster and the emotion higher in a shorter work than I can in a longer work in a way of Kings book I'm trying lots of ups and downs I'm trying a steady ramp of a lot of these things but then lulls where we have scenes where characters are just sitting around the fire chatting and having fun and remembering how much they they enjoy being around each other to give us a relief from some of the moments of tension do you have another question for right okay all right let's talk about humor um I would recommend to you that you go to some humorous and listen to what they have to say Howard Taylor my friend and writing", "2488": " excuses co-host um talks about humor in excellent ways and he is a better source than I am though I do know enough about this to start talking about it a little bit and so let's talk about humor humor works best either as a relief from some other tension as a way of creating character familiarity or division between characters or particularly humor works best when there's a lot of different types of humor humor is tough because humor is one of the most subjective things you will put in your book what you find funny is going to often be more distinctive to you than what you find exciting generally excitement and some of these emotions are more broad-based humor tends to be a little more individualized and the other thing to keep remembering cluded is the readers investment in your story has a large effect on whether something feels melodramatic meaning overly a sentimental or dramatic just regular dramatic you can see this by picking up a very dramatic story and reading only the ending and when you don't have connection to the characters it will feel way more sentimental to you a lot of times then if you are reading the book and it's a well-written book and you are getting to the end and you've been on the journey with these characters where you're like wow this emotion is earned therefore I'm going to let myself feel it emotion doesn't need to humour doesn't need to be earned as much as the other ones do so let's talk about a few aspects of humor so there are a couple of broad categories of humor you can use and these tend to be good at tends to be good to add a variety of these right so one of the large categories is what we call the comic drop the comic drop is where you are taking a person who is a high level of respect competence self-respect arrogance you might say and you are dropping them through a comment made by someone in the story or by a situation if you've ever seen a story where someone talks where a character's like I am so great and awesome I just succeeded they didn't say that like the character holds up the trophy that they have won and then like you know an egg hits them in the head right this is like complete undercut of the emotional moment by dropping that character from a place of security and strength to a place of being laughed at and the comic drop is one of the more useful types of humor you can you understand though that if you drop somebody who's already low that will actually drop the person making the joke more than it drops the person this is what we call about punching up or punching down when the person is standing on top of the podium and they have been victorious and they get an egg in the face that is very different than the person who is walking away slumped because they didn't finish the race because you know they tripped and fell and then someone throws an egg at them that characters not that character is being dropped a little bit but the person who threw the egg is the one who is really gonna get our ire so where do you use your comic drops is is one of the things that you can control you can also show banter between characters a lot of banters between characters involves a comic drop of some sort it involves a character laughing in another character and then coming back with a nice comeback that drops them a little bit but in a way that makes everybody smile even the character smiling so you the reader can feel like you're in on the joke you're all together and you're having fun when lopen glues his face to the floor and everyone laughs lopen has dropped himself this is one of the things Logan does here this is why one of the reasons he's an endearing character is he's willing to drop himself and have fun with it and laugh at himself and so in some ways he's doing a comic drop we are laughing at him and we're liking him more in the same situation so another sort of humor is the juxtaposition juxtaposition so things that don't", "2763": " belong together juxtaposed are often very funny this is the source of humor in a lot of the the movies that you'll see about you know he is a strong tough cop and his companion is a six-year-old with you know in a Tinkerbell outfit or whatever the idea of these two things alone are not necessarily funny but these two things together make us laugh your comic just juxtapositions you do have to be careful about because a lot of comic just a positions are going to by their nature make your story funny rather than making your characters funny a comic drop is generally done by the characters or people in the story and it's its humor that's in the story but for instance that story I told you you would not expect that to be a really tense drama about a character getting over you know some difficult thing in their life you'll probably add a little bit of that but you'll understand that the reader is mostly going to laugh about these two paired characters who do not get along the comic juxtaposition can just be used in joke form as well but again the more you use it the more jokey it can make your entire story again I am NOT an expert in this and so a lot of things I'm going to be saying don't fit into the big theme there people can talk about this thematically a lot better but is the rule of three this goes along with juxtaposition that a rule of three the idea for that I should stand away from it so you can actually see it on the board the idea of rule of three is that when you show things happen in a sequence you are going you are going to be expecting some sort of tying together of these thematic elements and or some sort of reversal for the third one and so for instance you can use the rule of three to to have a list of things where the third one is a juxtaposition or where the third one is a comic drop or where the third one is something that is finally you know the expected one and in example of this see if I can buy an example so example of this there is a there there is a an old Bruce Willis movie that is really weird called what's the Hudson Hawk so weird if they tried to do a really a comedic action thing and they strayed a little bit too much into chucks position and comic drops on Bruce Willis's character to the point that nobody knew how to take it it played a little bit like The Last Action Hero if you've seen that where I actually think Last Action Hero works really well whereas Hudson Hawk is like fascinating but one of the running jokes in this is this idea that he wants a cup of coffee right and every time he goes to take a cup of coffee get his drink of coffee something happens to the coffee and this kind of plays into a play on the rule of three means repetition repetition with", "2968": " some little variants in the repetition is innately funny to us so Bruce Willis goes to get a cup of coffee and the first time something mundane stops him right I can't remember what it is in the story so we'll just make up around the first time he he gets his cup of coffee he accidentally leaves it behind the second time it's a little sillier right he goes to get his cup of coffee and this time someone else walks by and takes it and starts drinking it the third time you do something completely ridiculous I do know this what is in the story he picks up his cup of coffee and someone shoots the cup out of his hand and it explodes right and so because we've done the repetition Bruce Willis can't have his coffee and because we're seeing this idea of the the rule of three I don't think the coffee thing in that movie is actually a thing I think it goes far beyond that but the idea is that escalation makes humor the more you escalate this thing the more interesting it becomes and one thing to be aware of with humor is that you want to start small with this escalation for the same sort of reason that if it's always up here it's always completely crazy then you you're not going to enjoy it as much as if it starts normal a lot of times if the situations are really crazy at the end of the stay in the story your buy-in is much lower but if it starts normal and then gets ridiculous by the end you are buying into very very insane situations a lot of what we kind of call the comic farce the you know like the Chevy Chase vacay movies the way these work is by starting with a small little thing that is going wrong and then the characters bumbling inability to deal with it escalates the situation to something that seems normal then this seems a little less normal and then seems completely outlandish but since each step is very small we are laughing at how Chevy Chase is able to top how ridiculous the situation is each given time but so couple of couple of things to help you I really would point you toward other humorous do realize that there are also kind of general themes of humor there is what we would call let me erase this guy and I try to", "3113": " in my books have a little bit of each of these so there's what we call character humor character humor is our humor that is often a character is just innately a little odd this is lopen glues his face to the floor Logan is really interested in using the magic to to get women lopen is fun because he's got very relatable sort of issues he wants to get women but his way of doing it is they'll really like me if I can glue my friends to the wall they'll think that's great that is character humor there is relationship humor this is when two characters quirks play off of it in a way that it exaggerated s' their quirks that juxtaposes their quirks and in this type of relationship humor is just fun to watch this is generally very good for this is generally good for building camaraderie between a team this is where your banter comes in there is a related one which is the insult humor where if someone is coming dropping someone else and making you laugh at it and then there is textual these are dad jokes right these are your your puns on the very nature of you know your standard you joke I love these I am a dad so it makes sense but generally a good book long book is gonna have a little bit of each of these going on in the story and that variety make sure that somebody's going to laugh or everyone's gonna laugh at something in your story even if they find some of the humor to be grating and not work on them all right what time are we at here we've got 20 minutes left so let's see I had a good time in person for the first time well I'm glad let's see when is introspection good for for characters this is actually a great question introspection is one of those things that's generally good for all characters but is generally you generally need much less of it than your instincts will want you to use and so all characters need a little bit of extra introspection I feel unless you're writing in some interesting cinematic form where you're not being inside of anyone's heads every character is going to at some point think man that just sucked I can't get over how much that thing that happened to me just sucked by having them think about something like that it just makes them feel like a real human being now one of the things that you may run into is that some people I am one of these have a narrative in their head they think to themselves I think to myself that just sucked when something happens that's up some people do not think like that it's more of an emotion or impression to them and so they aren't having a constant narrative of voice in their heads and writing different characters in different ways like this could be something you could try is very difficult to do another question from over here yeah specifically how you multiple plots and subplots without a feeling okay sander lanch so how do you converge all of these different plots so this is something I love in stories if you can't tell from the way I write my stories a spectacular ending where multiple plot threads come together at once it's just this is what I'm in it for right this is why I love it some tips so early in my career before I got published I started using these sander Lance's very naturally and I found actually that it was easy to lose track of some of the smaller climactic moments --is moments when you are constantly one-upping them with multiple other moments and so it became one of the things I had to practice was learning which moments together in an avalanche could be not forgotten and this is a matter of if we kind of go back to what we were talking about before this idea of of making sure that everything's not at a ten all the time you can imagine your character emotions on this thing and you have three characters who are all kind of let's grab a couple of different colors for this you've got three characters and they all have emotional journeys that you know one looks like this and then up the next one starts a little higher but then you know Falls and is not learning but then you know their emotions get high and right the end they spike and then character three has a more gradual sort of subtle you know we're not doing and then their arc is like that and they go like this or actually it would be so they get to their height right here all right let's use that you can see how theoretically this character's emotional moment and journey is going to completely be consumed by the fact that these very very dramatic moments are happening where you've brought multiple characters up to a ten where the action perhaps is up at a 10 where things are exploding and things like that well as another character is maybe realizing that all along their mother cared for them and that's just a warm thing for them to come to understand this characters arc is going to be better completed as I originally drew it over here where you get to while this character's arc is going down have a little high for this character where they come to their kind of realization where they can shine a little bit on their own where these two you want it you're going to interweave because they're kind of both getting to the same heights at the same time and so you want this to kind of be a one-two punch where you're in one character's head and something is happening and then what's happening to this character if you can do it right will relate to this character in some way so that they're kind of their plots are feeding off of each other and you're feeling like they're part of one great hole where they're intersecting this tends to work much better than having them separate if you're gonna have these separate bringing this one to their climax here and this one to their climax there is generally going to be a better choice for you also remember avoid having twists just to have twists early in my career I cut this from a laundress but I had one of the characters turn out to have at the end of the book a completely different heritage that he had been hiding the entire time from everyone else because I thought it was a cool twist it added nothing to the book in fact it was like something went like this and then ramped all the way up to ten because it's like oh this character came out of nowhere having a background similar to me and it's really important it's tying in and it didn't actually it meant nothing it was just confusing and the readers like wait why I can't focus on these other twists because you have too many twists happening twist four twists sake are generally not going to be as effective as making sure that it adds something to the character dynamic and that it reveals something about the plot and setting so there are some tips for you he says if the character is not going to get a happy ending what promises do you give at the beginning of a story so that you don't give too much away okay don't you have to reader up dissatisfied so this is an excellent question because you can write a tragedy where a character does not get a happy ending and where you are left sad that is kind of the point of a tragedy is you did not get what you wanted to get this can be very unsatisfying in a good way sometimes that's what you tried to do most of the time you want to give an indication that this is possible in the world do you do this by raising the question right if the character is a you're having a classic tragedy the characters flaw is going to prevent them from making the correct decision at the end of the story or their flaw early on is going to snowball to cause them to have consequences this is very easy to foreshadow because you are showing the same story you would as if they succeed with the same sort of foreshadowing except at the end they make the wrong choice and if it were if it were tense in the book where they made the right choice then you're foreshadowing would have been in place that they could have potentially made the wrong choice now I would generally recommend adding to this something else to balance it out generally a character who makes a right choice as a contrast or showing early in the story that this is a story that is that is a world full of tragedy and you are watching to see that tragedy unfold by giving foreshadowing by showing some characters have tragic ends earlier in the story another way that you can do this is of course the the sort of good version of a bait-and-switch where you show you give an early promise and then you show through the course of the story that the character doesn't deserve that that at the end the reader is supposed to be rooting for them to not get the ending because they don't deserve it they weren't worthy of it or flipping on their head the thing that the character is told they're supposed to want the character by the end of the story is realized that they don't want and so therefore when they don't get their happy ending it's happy in a different way because that character has learned they want something else more this does happen a lot in your again if we go back to the classic Hollywood action ending where what is the character want they want to you know to be in love and be with the person they love but what do they need they need to save the world so that person that love doesn't die so in the end this character makes a heroic sacrifice does not get the happy ending to be with the character they want to be with but also at the same time has achieved the need that the world needed which is saving the world this is kind of a classic bittersweet ending for an action hero so lots of different dynamics you can take here lots of different directions you can take it the tone of your story is going to influence this a great deal but make sure that you're giving that promise that it could be a decision that the character might not get what they want even in a story where they do okay great question how do you know if a character's story is going to need multiple books and how do you know where to break that story so worrying about multiple books is one of these things that I find new authors do too much because in general you will be better served as a new writer if you pretend you need to do the full art for a character in a single volume and give your best and your all to it obviously as experienced writers and some of you are obviously already experienced writers or want to try something a little more difficult know that characters having arcs across multiple books is also very important one of my rules of thumb is make the first book as satisfying as you can make sure that there is a complete arc for a character you generally do this if you're going to be splitting up your characters arc in tumult by splitting it up into multiple steps for instance we can go back to Star Wars the prime example that I often use the original trilogy of course in Star Wars Luke has an arc in three parts and we are presented only with the first version of his arc early in the story the first version was arc as he wants to go off into the stars in have an adventure then later on when he makes obi-wan obi-wan presents another step in that arc you are going to have to learn to become a Jedi Master and during the course of the story the I go off into the stars and have an adventure goes through a complete arc while the you have to go and become a Jedi goes to step number one learning to trust the force and if you were plotting this story ahead of time you would say okay step number one learn to trust the force step number two control your rage and your emotions step number three confront your father figure and redeem him instead of killing him this is your journey as a Jedi so movie one he learns to trust the force movie two he has trouble trusting his emotions and fails at it movie three he has learned to masters emotion goes to the end proves this by renaming his father instead of killing him if you came up with that arc and you and the first one said I'm gonna get make this first one learning to trust the force I'm gonna give it its own full arc in the story Luke is gonna fail to trust the force and get shocked by the little thing flying around him he's going to have a contrary opinion that says this is all bunk you shouldn't listen to any of it he's going to have a challenge at the end where he has to decide if he's listening to the guy who said blasters are really cool don't listen to force or his ghost dad who says listen to the force Luke he's going to choose between those two learn to trust the force and be rewarded by being able to make the shot that is impossible that the targeting system has already shown that another character was not able to use to make the shot so you have a full complete arc of what is step one so if you get good at this what you're going to decide you're gonna do is you're gonna say how can I make step one in this character's journey completely fulfilling in and of itself using all the tools that a writer uses to make something fulfilling if yes do that arc and write that book and then the next step in the next book if you're worried about this though a lot of times doing the full art in a story for a character can be very can be great practice it can make for a stronger story and afterward you can say alright the character is here in their life now what other challenges can I give them now that they feel like they've mastered this one art how can I put a challenge in front of them that makes them uncertain that they can continue and persist in this how can I make this character have to prove that they can hold on to and you know do some enduring to the end sort of sort of stuff but you can always with a character find something more to explore in them just do be aware that the longer your series becomes the more difficult this becomes for the reader to continue suspending their disbelief that this character is going to go through 14 different arcs and 14 different stories and that is a real and difficult thing to deal with but there are very few models of how to do this and you're gonna have to find your own way in doing it so if you're planning a 14 book series which right now I would say just write the first one the best you can and then sit back and ask yourself alright can I now plot more books for this character where each one is going to be fulfilling and I'll break it up alright how do you develop villains off-camera that is a surprise okay so you do need to do this once in a while develop characters off screen off the page so that when they show up it's either surprise or it's an interesting reveal and but you don't do this often but you do have to do it what I think you're talking about is where I'll see if I can find a great example of this in cinema or something like that there's an old movie called mystery men where they talk about the coolest superhero who ever existed being this guy who can cut guns in half with his mind and this character is not on stage until midway through the movie where someone shows up and a bunch of guns get cut in half and they're like oh it's the dude who can cut guns in half with his mind that's so cool because the rest of us have lame superpowers and that one's actually useful and it works very well as a reveal in that movie this is I think the sort of thing you're talking about you developing a character by their lore and this is generally what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to have characters talk about this other character you're gonna have one to have characters this character has had an influence on the world that is plainly visible and you do this with all the stuff that I've been talking about with other world building elements this person becomes a world building element until they step onto the page and becomes a character and at that moment you're gonna have to transition them out of legend and myth which is going to be a little by nature trophy and into person and that transition is the hard thing building up the lore of them is not necessarily that difficult um then treat it like any sort of world building element that you would that you would use last question yeah oh great question so how do you do this this graph while also making the characters have autonomy right and so that is really great you are going to want to make sure that your characters are by this point like what is this ramped up this is generally the point where a crisis is happening for the character and their knowing they're going to have to make a decision and this point should be a decision by the character one way or the other in here you generally want to show them making small decisions along this way and either failing or succeeding and then bearing the consequences for instance if your arc is the character needs to be more brave right and needs to you know grab the sword and charge the enemy army to inspire everyone else who's too afraid to do so to join in with them so if you going to do that you would earlier want to give them a chance to make that decision and either fail or make it correctly and then have terrible consequences on it so the reader is uncertain if they'll make it again this sort of thing having those decision points built along that where the characters actual actions change the plot in the course of the story that needs to start happening way earlier in your story then your climax and so the character failing to pick up the sword and go charging for whatever reason should have a consequence the reader notices and feels as a consequence the character has autonomy it's just the sort of thing where you're like man this is a kick in the stomach this sort of thing giving your characters an influence over the plot is really important particularly after about the first third generally and in the first third you can have the character be inactive some stories manage to make it go through two-thirds if you're doing this make them have control over small aspects of their life even if they can't have control of the large aspects of their life the more and the sooner you can move the character into making decisions that have really relevant to the story the better this is generally something you want to do more of not less all right guys we will come back next week leave us some feedback if for some reason this didn't work digitally for you and next week we will talk about the business of writing I'll have two fire hose ones for you where we talk about that and then we'll do another QA to wrap it up on business alright remember to take your tests or your quizzes thanks boo bye"}, "12": {"0": " okay so if you guys are in the chat let us know and if you are a student in my class or not let us know you non students are perfectly welcome since we put this up for everyone lots of behind the scenes

it is sorry I'm going off scam camera for a second so I keep track of this only seven minutes late not too bad alright let's begin we are going to be doing the", "292": " publishing lecture today we're going to do two of these next week we will cover indie publishing and this week we are going to be focusing mostly on traditional publishing this is going to be a bit of a firehose lecture I apologize for that I'm going to throw a lot of information at you but the good thing is it's up on YouTube so you can watch it again later if if some of this is too much for you the way I'm gonna format this lecture is I'm going to step you through", "320": " how a book is created and explain all the different kind of behind-the-scenes people who are involved in it we should talk we'll be talking about agents we'll be talking about marketing yourself to publishers and that sort of thing so lots of whiteboard this week so let's start with the publisher so the", "337": " publisher on a book is usually somebody", "342": " who has started what we call or is running what we call an imprint back in the day 6070 years ago these were all independent publishers they would start up a business usually named after themselves and they would be acquiring books and publishing these days almost all of these are owned by 5 the big five publishers though there are some very large book companies that are not part of that for instance scholastic is not part of the Big Five and they are very large publisher but generally everything is under a big one the big publishers and a lot of these imprints are mini little shall we say cities in the publishing Empire so in a big company like McMillan which is one of my publishers there is an imprint called tor books which was founded by Tom Doherty back in the late 70s early 80s was run as a separate independent publisher for a while and then acquired by Macmillan in the 90s Tom Doherty is still the publisher of that imprint at tor a publisher is primarily a business person and they have several people underneath them that you probably should know about they have what's called an editorial director they have editors and they have acquisitions editors and there's also sometimes VPS or you know assistant publishers different types of names so what is this doing basically your publishers job is to handle the business side of things and the editors job is to handle editorial the editors job is to acquire books for the publisher to publish now what you should understand is that these roles are often held by not held by separate individuals depending on the company for instance at tour for many years Tom Doherty was also the editorial director Harriet mcdougal was the editorial director at first she retired it became Robert Jordans editor only and his wife and Tom Doherty basically became the editorial director an editorial directors job is to oversee the editors to make sure that they are doing their jobs basically middle management in charge of editors an editor's job is to work with an author in ways we'll explain later to take the book to make it better to perfect it and kind of be basically a project manager sorry barely read that editors kind of like a project manager their job is to oversee each project which is a book and an acquisitions editor is somebody who reads through what we call the slush pile slush pile is all of the submissions that have been sent in to the publisher the people who want their books to be published and the acquisitions editor reads to them and finds books that they want to publish now at tour for example and a lot of companies these are not two separate jobs much of the time indeed a lot of times the editor is the acquisitions editor or the editor has an assistant whose job is to help them with all of their work and will also act as a partial acquisitions editor for them and that the assistant will not be acquiring themselves they'll just be looking for promising manuscripts to give to the editor that the editor might want to my editor at tor Moshe fader was the assistant to another editor for many years helped him with acquiring books and with editing them and then eventually was told you are allowed to now acquire for yourself and then motion went out and started to look for authors to acquire for himself and moved up into being an editor so this is just useful to know about the publishers you're submitting to to know which imprint has who is their publisher at Random House which publishes my team books we have a basically editorial director slash publisher all wrapped up in one who is not the head publisher but is in charge of a small group of editors her name is Beverly and she doesn't acquire she just manages these editors normally the people in this position are going to do much less acquisitions in fact they may not do any once in a blue moon a friend of Tom's would want to publish a book and Tom would would read it himself and be like you know what I really like this if it's tour he would then assign it to one of his editors and say you become the editor on this project I don't believe that Beverly over it at Random House Delacorte is the imprint there that I published with does any acquisition herself she just oversees everyone else once in a while an editorial director will have their own line of books they're publishing while they're overseeing everyone else and that fact that was the case with Harriet at tour before she retired from that position so it's useful to know because this will influence who you're sending your books to who you are targeting and who you want to buy them for instance at tour approaching Tom Doherty directly is probably not going to work for you like I said once in a while one of his friends or someone he knows or some some contact you will make him say you know what I'm gonna acquire this book but most of the time at tour you're gonna be looking for directly at the editors and trying to pitch your books to them how do you do that well this takes us into kind of Phase two this over here we'll talk about how books get to these people and they come through to general format our avenues one is agents and one is direct over the years that was a really weird way to write direct print over the years publishing has moved less direct and more agented this has been a continual trend that began decades ago and is still a continuing trend that more and more publishers are saying on their submission guidelines that they do not take on agented submissions the big shift in this as I understand happened really in the 80s and 90s where agents started to shoulder more of the burden of reading slush and picking out the gems and sending those directly to the editors this is how most books I would say these days are sold traditionally is that an author picks up an agent the agent then takes it to all the editors in town pitches the book to them picks and gets offers back goes back to the author and says here's our offers what do you want to do in these sorts of things direct still happens I sold direct I sold a Elantra to tour books in 2003 through a submission directly to an editor that I had met at a convention that was Moshe instead of having an agent I was submitting to agents at the same time but I sold directly now one of the questions that arises a lot regarding this is should I be hunting an agent should I be going direct as I said direct is actually getting harder and harder to do most agents will say to you and most editors probably as well will say your best bet is the hunt an agent first don't submit the book to editors directly the reason they say this is because if an agent picks up a book then finds out you've actually submitted it to every editor already and they've rejected it that agent will feel like this book has already gone through the town and is therefore soiled good I don't know it's like they can't sell this book that's the fear that they have I will tell you a contrasting opinion of that I think that that opinion is wise and valid there is an argument for", "851": " sending directly to editors I might be survivorship biasing this one because it worked for me but my argue to myself was always I might as well double the number of places I can send books to and if it turns out that an agent picks up a book that I've already sent out a bunch well then they will have better avenues for selling that and get the get the editors to take another look at it or I will just give them a new book because I write quickly enough that if they feel like this book has already seen the town well then if they're willing to pick up one of my books there's a decent chance because I write so much they will like the other ones as well in fact an agent is not looking for a book they're looking for an author agents generally want to represent an author during the early part of their career and then reap benefits later in fact this whole industry for most of its life has been focused on this idea the idea that a new author is a money-losing proposition in most cases for a publisher a brand new author takes time to launch a brand new authors first books are generally not going to sell a ton of copies and it's over time with that author establishing a fan base that becomes then that author becoming popular that is what they are looking for so in general through the course of the history that's what they wanted and I'm a good example of that Elantra sold fine it did just fine but it wasn't probably even paying the bills for tour in the long run but Mistborn the whole trilogy ended up selling better and then the way of Kings ended up doing even better and suddenly I am one of their best-selling authors in fact I think I might be tour's best-selling author and because of this now those books are extremely profitable for tour when early they lost money on me so in ideal world everyone is looking for authors to build up over time the unfortunate about this is over the years this has become less of a theme and it's become more bestseller driven what do I mean by bestseller driven so for a long for for most of entertainment let's just say this and most of entertainment the the pieces of media that do highly successful business pay for all the risks you take on ones that don't sell as well and then you will have something in the middle called the mid list in books a midlist book is a book that makes money for the publisher pays for itself but doesn't make so much that it's really funding anything else these are successful books by career authors who have a dedicated fan base but not a huge one these people were very important to publishing for many many many years because them an aggregate would be as much money to the publisher as their few headliners of which they'd only have a couple and so keep maintaining a really strong mid list was a very important part of the business however some things have happened one is in the publishing and indie publishing has began to bite in out that mid list quite a bit take big chunks out of it because generally if you're a mid list author it is more profitable for you to independently published than it is to publish with a publisher this is because all of if you have a small consistent fan base that is not growing but is also not shrinking then and they are willing to buy every book you put out you don't need marketing budgets you don't need huge marketing campaigns you can directly target that audience yourself and you can sell to them and you will make a much better cut of the money doing that and because of that a bunch of people who would be miss Lister's are now indie publishing because of that publishing has said well we need to focus more on the hits we need more hits the other thing that happened that caused this is some consolidation in the book industry when a lot of the small bookstores folded and the large conglomerate change took over which was a big process happening through the 80s and 90s into the 2000s what happened is a lot of niche bookstores that were very good sellers for midlist vanished for instance there would be bookstores in the past Tom dougherty tells the story of it's not even a bookstore it's like the corner store the truck stop let's say he often used this one so the truck stop exists and in that truck stop there are a bunch of truckers come through who really like westerns and Tom dougherty could publish a few midlist Western books and he could get those into those truck stops and his bulk of his audience was these truckers who would buy them well during the 90s what happened is books started to consolidate into only the big bookstores and the truck stops stopped being able to sell as many books because people were going to Barnes and Nobles and things and what was happening is that some of these niche markets were drying up the distributor's where it wasn't worth their money to go to all these little chains anymore and put these books in because it was just so much overhead to hire all those um those people that even though there was an audience for those books those books were no longer profitable or as profitable as sending them all to the big corner bookstore which then was going to be more hit driven plus a lot of your markets started getting picked up by places like Costco and things like this where you weren't selling niche books you were selling very hit driven books someone going to Costco is looking for the nude and buck they are not looking for the new niche western book that a lot of truckers might like but there's a small enough segment that is just not profitable I could go into this for hours trust me I'm just giving you a summary I'm getting some details wrong on this but the end result was the publishers feeling they needed to be more hit driven and so they started to focus on let's buy a book see if it explodes big if it doesn't explode big we drop that author and put another author in that slot because the book that has come out yet has that chance of being really huge very rare chance but it has a chance once an author is a known quantity there's this sense that a midlist urn will remain a mid lister and that there are some upper echelons or like cut those mid Lister's let's look for more hits this is fallacious you may be saying wait a minute do men Lister's never become bestsellers George our Martin was a quintessential mid lister all through the 70s and 80s and became the biggest epic fantasy writer in the business in the 90s and the 2000s great example of someone who had a long career with some dedicated fans and then wrote a book that just connected with everybody and it spread from those fans like wildfire to the rest of the world so I think you know personally in the long run this old method is still better for writers readers and authors but that is not necessarily how some executives think about it so be warned hit driven is kind of a thing now let's go back to this sort of thing and let's talk a little bit about agents for you and then we'll talk about direct publishing yourself and this is going to answer some of your questions that are popping up so what is an agent agents are people", "1321": " who let's say in Hollywood agents have", "1325": " this kind of reputation where you know maybe this whole slimy meanness reputation and things in New York book agents generally have a very good reputation I rarely hear authors speak ill of their agent and if they do it's a raishin ship that's on the rocks and the author generally leaves that agent and goes to someone else agents tend to be very good at being their authors advocate in the business and so I really like my agent I think highly of him I think highly of agents in general I will give you the counter argument to agents in a minute here but let's talk about what agents do so an agent's a pro you know what let's let's do direct for a minute it'll explain better if I talk about direct so to publish direct sorry for that lane change here to publish direct with a", "1397": " publisher for many years and still viable what you would do is you would take a full and completed novel you're not selling on proposal in fiction nonfiction you can often sell in proposal and nonfiction let's say you are a person who has lived their life as a Ana specialist career you are you are a rock star or you are somebody who knows a ton about weight loss or things like this you can rely on your credentials and an outline to say what I'm gonna write in a how-to book on this you can sell them proposal does not happen in publishing by new authors an established author can sell an proposal and usually will you won't yet you need a completed novel alright so you take your completed novel and you will then start sending it out via a query letter so stage number one is query uue rry I think a query is a one-page synopsis of your book usually the format follows this sort of you know paragraph about the book little paragraph about yourself and talking about at the end asking that they review the book and ask if they're interested I am terrible at queries so I'm going to refer you to lots of resources online about how to write a good query google it there are people who are way better at it than I am I was always terrible at queries I still don't really think that I'm good at queries when I asked my agent what made a good query he basically said credentials basic premise some sort of hook few rhetorical questions meaning stay away from the what would happen in a world he doesn't like those that's personal to him but just kind of the the premise in short this is a heist novel about a group of thieves who want to rob the Dark Lord of the world after the prophecy prophesied hero failed to bring the Dark Lord down there's your your kind of hope sentence for Mistborn a little about myself would fall out / do you have credentials if you publish short stories or things like this and then following a little bit longer sort of summary about the book hitting only maybe one or two key elements that make it really interesting potentially some comps saying if I were trying this right now I'd say it has a feel a little bit like Scott Lynch's series don't say it's Harry Potter meet Lord of the Ring actually do like a real comp and then get out but I'm gonna refer you to other people to explain to you how to write a good query usually you will send the query then those queries that you send out a small small percentage of the editors will write back and ask for sample chapters and all the years I was doing this I got one response to a query asking for sample chapters out of dozens of petanque upon dozens that I sent out that was to Joshua my the person who eventually became my agent he didn't pick me up before I sold my books somewhere else but he did pick me up after if they liked the sample chapters they at when they were impressed a full manuscript alright they will then read the full manuscript and if they like it they will then make and offer this is the way the process is supposed to go I don't know how often it actually goes like this you'd have to ask an editor how often I did remember reading an editor once saying out of every hundred queries they got they asked for sample chapters on about ten out of every ten sample chapters they asked on a full manuscript about one and an about of every ten full manuscripts they got they made an offer on one that seemed like a pretty too even a number a percentage slipped down to be real but there's at least one look at it now this might seem soul-crushing to you it certainly did to me when I was trying to break in because the odds of getting through all of this seemed really low there are a few things that improve your odds particularly once you get to this stage most people who want to publish books do not know what they're doing most people are have not actually written a lot they have written one novel they may not have even finished it despite submitting it they have not watched lectures on this and most people their books can get dismissed very quickly based on the sample chapters", "1686": " queries I don't know I hate queries if you can't tell but it seems like the same way one of the the ostensibly the reasons for query is that the agents will take all the books that are written by people who seem professional that was not my my experience but that's what they say your mileage may value may vary but my one of my goals was always to skip the query stage after sending all those queries on you know books I knew were pretty good in fact launchers was included in that and getting no no answers I started this figure can't I somehow jump to the sample chapter stage because once they rejected me on sample chapters at least they're rejecting me on my prose and my storytelling not on my ability to write a summary and a good business letter the way that I went about this is by trying to meet the editors directly going to conventions listening to them at conferences trying to read what they write online about books and things like this and trying to ask them directly hey I've got a book that I think would really match you would you be willing to take a look at it and almost every time that I asked someone in person they said yeah send me sample chapters which skipped this step for me again your mileage may value I don't know how many editors these days this was 20 years ago that I was doing this how many others these days are willing to look at on a submissions at all I still know that if you go to concurrences that a lot of times editors at conferences will ask for sample chapters by the way this is also the process by which you get an agent the same sort of query sample chapters full manuscript offer is is almost exactly the same process for picking up an agent and agents go to conferences and conventions as well so how do you meet these people well one of the methods is this conference method", "1809": " this conference method is that by the way I will split conventions and conferences into two part into two things when I say a convention I mean something like world fantasy convention world horror convention world con these are fan-run conventions that are not professionally focused world fantasy tends to be the most professionally focused of those but basically they're not for profit they're gatherings of authors who and agents and editors who get together to talk about the business and about writing or in the case of world con to talk about who's the best Star Trek captain and editors happen to be there and they are working and you can hear them on panels and you can to them conferences are different this is like locally we have one called", "1859": " writers for young readers conferences tend to be you pay a larger ticket price to get in an editor or an agent often is a guest brought in there are pitch sessions with them professional offers are often your part of what you're paying for is critiques from professional authors and a lot of writers conferences fall into this category these are ways to network both with authors around your writing skill level or professional level and to meet editors and agents it's still very hard it is very difficult and it is still a little soul-crushing I understand that but this is a method you can use you can also follow these editors and agents on Twitter or on Facebook or things like this see what they're saying you can at", "1907": " least put into your query letters some personalized information I would recommend if you're going this this route imagine two different query letters right so we imagine query letter from author a and co-author a says dear acquisitions editor I would like you to read my book such-and-such it's really great here is why thank you for your consideration perfectly professional well-written query letter imagine you", "1932": " get another query letter that says dear put in the actual name of the editor say dear Moshe fader I am a big fan of Brandon Sanderson's work and I know you are his editor I've been following the other authors you've released lately including this one this one and think your editorial eye is very sharp and indeed I feel like the writing that I write matches what you might enjoy because I like for instance very intricate magic systems that are easy to understand and a focus on characters interaction with their setting here is my book such and such and such I hope that you will give it consideration that second query letter if written well is going to probably get a better chance of response than the first one this requires you to do your research you have to know who the editors are at the publisher and if they're acquiring or not you have to know which authors they are editing and what books particularly by new authors that they've released recently you have to do a lot of legwork finding out all this stuff because it's not easy to find generally you're looking at acknowledgments pages of authors books you are googling online you're sometimes asking the author who their editor is that sort of stuff and whether they would recommend them in my case you probably do not want to submit to motion mosha takes very very few books he is a consulting editor at tor I can't remember the last time he picked up a new author in these most recent years he's mostly been editing me so you would want to find someone at tor who is probably newer and who is who is acquiring a lot that said moshe is a fantastic editor if by some luck you do end up with moshe he he is a really really good editor so you have to do all this work and it is a ton of work we talk about you know people having a little black book of you know all these these these people of that they are interested in dating and all their phone numbers and information you need a little black book that says here's the publisher of this imprint here is the are the editors at this imprint who are acquiring here are books they've released in the last couple of years that they acquired bright new authors and read those books and start to get a sense for it that sounds like a lot of work one of the readings that agents do now going back over here the", "2078": " pros of agents what they're gonna do is they do all that legwork they're one of their primary jobs is to know in person all of the different editors at all of the different publishers and the books that they have released recently and things they've said about what they're looking for by the way never ask an editor what they're looking for quick tip ask them what they bought recently if you ask what they're looking for they won't want to pigeonhole themselves because they wouldn't want to exclude a book that they don't know they're looking for yet that is really fantastic so they all hate that question but if you say what's the most recent book that you acquired by a brand new author and why did you acquire it much better question to ask an editor gets them talking about what made them pick up this book and and that sort of thing and granted you don't always want to send an editor the exact thing they've just acquired because they just acquired that so they won't need another book just like that but it can be really handy to get a feel for what the the editor likes editorially alright so agents do all that legwork they're going to lunch with these editors they are meeting them at you know cocktail parties they are keeping lists of who's bought what recently all that stuff an agent is also a negotiator when you get that offer from a publisher the agent is an expert in contracts specifically publishing contracts they will know what's what should be in a contract and I should put in here contracts they will know what you can argue for and what you can't argue for as a new author or at least how hard it is to argue for things you can ask for anything anything you can argue for what you're likely to get they'll know they will know your worth as an author because they will know you know edit our publishers need books if this is all like why this is so hard understand you have something they want even though you're a brand-new author they need books to publish they can't rely on Brandon Sanderson forever because Brandon Sanderson is eventually not going to have books for them anymore hopefully not for many many years but they know this they need what you have so you have innate value to the publisher and the agents will know how to exploit that value to its fullest extent to negotiate for the best deal they also can offer editorial an agent a good agent often knows how to help an author make a book work better for the UM for the editors and can do kind of a first editorial pass to fix things that might turn editors off at the beginning and help them want to pick up the book so with all of these things why would you not want an agent well let's talk about the cons not conventions but cons", "2254": " of having agents number one is they take 15% they take 15% of the two off the top of every contract in fact the way that most of the business is done the the publisher sends money to the agent who takes 15% out and sends the rest to you now this can be a slight advantage in consolidation of ioin of your money for instance at the end of the year I get from my agent a summary of everything we've gotten and basically a 1099 from them saying here is all the money that we have paid to you in one easy form for taxes but this can also be a con sum once in a while doesn't happen often once in a while an agent is and it has happened that authors have been not paying attention to what their actual in money in was and agents were taking more than they should again very rare but there are some people who don't like agents say if you do get an agent make the money be split at the publisher and not in the agent the publisher sends 15% of the agent and 85% to you full disclosure I do not do this it sounds like a huge hassle for the publisher and I do trust my agent but this is a legitimate concern about agents and one reason that people do not like agents another reason that people don't like agents is they do not want editorial as agents have become more and more the slush pile that publishers are are that people are submitting to and that they are then sending on to editors sometimes there is this conflict of interests where the agent feels like they don't want to submit anything but the best work they can find so that those editors will always be trusting to this agent only submits the most high quality work and therefore the agent you know goes to the top of the slush pile because of this agents will sometimes run of authors through many revisions on a book looking to get it editorially just as the agent wants it and on some people and I think this is a very legitimate concern who don't like agents will say that's not the agents job the agent job is to sell the book the agents job is not to be the editor of the book and if an agent is holding a book back from submitting it because they want it to be something it's not then that's dangerous because what if the agents opinion is wrong they have it revised all this other direction and the editors would have liked it better if it just would have been submitted some people say just submit the book don't go editorial you're gonna have to decide for yourself if you go traditionally traditionally published how much editorial you want from an agent and how much you're willing to take from an agent some agents for instance will not pick up an author until they've gone through a rounds of revision with every author to see if the author is willing to revise and is good at it some authors that's just not what they look for in an agent so be aware of that and there is this sometimes other conflicts of interests", "2455": " for instance let's say an agent could spend an extra couple of weeks negotiating on your contract and bring it up from getting ten thousand dollars in advance to say 20 thousand dollars and that agent looks at that and says my 15% on an hourly basis of the amount of work I would have to do to get this from 10,000 to 20,000 dollars is just not worth that hourly rate I should just tell the author to take the 10 grand whereas for you 10 grand to 20 grand as an advance could be the dividing line between you being able to go full-time at this or not so sometimes there's this conflict of interest with agents and good agents will acknowledge this and we'll kind of have a blanket our job is to get the best deal for our author regardless of how much time it takes as long as the author wants to keep pushing because otherwise we run into conflict of interest levels and this is why I based a lot of what I think a good agent does on what Joshua does Joshua is willing to spend months negotiating a contract for $500 for foreign rights on a book because it's kind of a matter of principle that he doesn't violate that he is always looking for the best deal for the author because to not be looking for the best deal the author leads you down this path of of madness so pretty legitimate gripes that people don't like about agents a lot of indie published people do not use agents at all if they do use agents they use them for another Cobb bonus than agent tab which is overseas overseas sales are very hard for you to sell on your own most indie authors I know do not sell overseas and in translation usually that is the age job the agent will take your book and we'll have deals with a lot of agents in other countries and they these agents in other countries will be already have a deal that anything the US agent picks up the agents say in France is going to accept as a client and try to sell in France this can be really good money particularly new as a new author one of the advantages we have in writing in the English language is that English language entertainment is generally entertainment leader worldwide just like French wine or you know German or Japanese cars have a reputation English language entertainment has a reputation for being very high quality and we benefit from that in that a lot of our books are able to be sold in many different countries for some times small deals but an aggregate make quite a bit of money for us this isn't to say that other countries don't have really vibrant and great local publishing enterprises of their own a lot of them do but this is an advantage we have plus the English language market is just so big that starting English language and going to smaller markets generally makes a lot of sense because if you are for instance or writing first language and you're writing in a language where there just aren't a lot of book sales then your advances will be so small that you can't live on it but if your English language and then picking up extra money from other sales I it can be it can work much better so regardless your agents one of their jobs will be to sell these books overseas and even before my first book came out Joshua had three deals for me overseas before the book was published and this is just a thing that agents tend to be very good at because it also makes a lot of sense for them to have their authors all around the world so let's go ahead and talk about some of the questions that we have here regarding agents and up until this point all right so and then we will dig into what happens when a book actually gets an offer on it okay so when do you give up on finding agent only when you decide that you want to go indie published as long as you want to be traditionally published you should be looking at getting an agent if you have these problems that would be another reason to not get an agent you should not give up on an agent because of rejections you should give up on an agent because you legitimately have problems with these sorts of things and don't think you want to use an agent it is still possible very hard but still possible to do and there are some indie authors who use an agent only for overseas contracts or things like that or you have decided to indie publish which we'll talk about next week there is a good argument for being what we call a hybrid author which is an author who's open to both avenues and I will talk about being a hybrid author next week as well all right so should agents", "2763": " be approached with complete books yes we already kind of covered that one", "2768": " what can a mid lister expect salary wise so a mid lister in general is someone that I would consider who is earning a part-time living at their money at their writing for instance they are making you know 10 to 20 grand all the way up to somebody who's making seventy to a hundred grand that's still midlist your money this is hard to talk about and give you an expectation for because your earnings will be directly tied to how many books you sell right and what is what counts as a mid lister how many books count as a mid listener this really depends on a lot of factors and I'll try to dig into this in in a few minutes okay when is a manga ship good enough to submit to an agent first second third I would recommend third draft is where you start this is going to be very individual to you but I recommend finish the book put it aside come back to it in six months do a solid revision of it get a bunch of early readers do a third draft incorporating what comments you think that they make that is good and then start submitting it as you practice revision you may get better at doing drafts in the future and as it's out for submission you may want to so listen another group of readers they can help you revise that book and make it better but there's no one answer but there's there's a quick one for you how", "2852": " hard is it to get a publisher to pick up a book after it's been indie published it really depends at that point on your success as an indie author well it's been a while so ask some editors directly but for a while been managing to sell 10 to 20,000 copies on your own was where the publishers started to sit up and take notice um it depends on the price point to write if your book is being read mostly as part of the Kindle whatever it is the where you pay a monthly fee and it can read as many of the the books that are in that in that group that you want that's not going to be as interesting if you're selling your book it want at 99 cents and you sell twenty thousand that's different than if you sell your book at 399 and you sell twenty thousand I don't have the hard numbers for you I would ask around on this to people who've done it see one of the problems you have with me is it's now been 20 years since I broke in and so my information though I try to keep very up-to-date it's just not going to be as good as people who are selling right now and breaking in right now or who are in depending right now in fact I'm going to hopefully hopefully you guys are watching Jenn and Becky are going to give me their notes on indie publishing these are two indie published authors who are in the class right now and they were gonna teach you next week the indie published lesson but because of this whole happening to go from houses and things like that and Quarantine I'm going to still teach it I do know a decent amount about it and hopefully they will be sending me their notes through that I can use to kind of understand how it's going right now but yeah is there a magazine website we can follow that would have this type of publishing industry information there are a bunch of different places again I'm not the best at tracking this anymore for a long time the absolute right forums called the absolute right water cooler was the place to go to find out about publishers and who the editors were and things like that I don't know if it's still up and running there are", "2971": " lots of resources for queries online that people talk about there Publishers Weekly often will list deals people make but you have to belong to their subscription service to see those deals so really this is something that also is gonna vary widely depending on your genre I'll try to give you a rundown either this week or next week of all of the big five publishers in sci-fi fantasy but you can then start to use as a guide for going out and finding these things but I don't even know all the others at or anymore because editors do tend to change and towards gone through some big revolutions lately and so I barely know the names of anybody at any of the publishers because now these days that's what my agents job was back in 2000 when I was trying to break in on you there all of their names and I had them all written down I just don't keep track of that anymore it's it's too much work to do when I don't have to do it if that makes sense I apologize for that do agents editors often get feedback or a reason for declining a book or is it radio silence so that's a great question generally it's radio silence if you get rejected on query and half or more of the time if you're ejected on sample chapters some of the time you will get feedback on sabda chapters will say this is why we rejected it every time I had a full manuscript get rejected I got full I got feedback explaining why if they are taking the effort to go through a full manuscript and read through it they generally are giving you feedback so it depends once you start getting personalized feedback it's a really good sign that you're getting close about a year before I broke in I started getting a lot of personalized feedback on my rejection letters there was a very good sign to me granted most of these were things that skipped the Quarian stage but yeah all right what are some warning", "3083": " signs we'll end with this one on this QA part that you should look out for with agents it's a really good question because there while there are certain kind of professional groups that collect agents that agents can belong to bad agents belong to the to these group professional organizations and good agents there are some that don't belong so the professional organizations are not a one-to-one correlation on a good age what you should be looking out for is this agent if you're going with this agent they should work at an agency that has sold books by new authors recently that you can find in bookstores okay the big danger that you're looking out for is someone who calls themself an agent and then is soliciting all of these things and then is funneling your books toward what we call vanity presses", "3139": " vanity presses are this segment of the book publishing industry that exists to charge you money to publish your books this is different from indie publishing and any publishing you're in control and you may pay for an editor you may pay for a for a cover in fact you should do both of those things and that is legit that's what you should be doing a lot of these kind of vanity presses they'll act like they're a traditional publisher some bad agents will exist simply to funnel people into them they'll say good news we've accepted your book all we need is $5,000 in order to publish your book these are people you should run away from full speed an agent who sends to any of these places is not a legitimate agent or at least as it is a legitimate agent with huge ethical problems going on and these publishers are not people that can do what you want them to do there are a very very small number of people that Vandy presses actually serve legitimately in my opinion and this is someone who has a book that they want to publish so they have lots of copies of it to give to their friends and family but who is not looking to make a career out of publishing there is a small chance that also a celebrity who does their book and wants to sell it like like let's say you were a rock star and you want to have a book for sale at your at your concerts to sell with like your CDs and things like that Vande publisher probably is a decent option for you but in most of these cases indie publishing the book on your own can be done print on demand so you can order as many copies as you want to sell yourself there'll be a very high price point you won't make a lot of money off of those print copies but the e-book copies you will be able to make money off of there's no reason to go with a vanity press from the majority of people you should just instant investigate indie publishing which again you will have to pay for but you do not need one of these vanity publishers and so stay far away if you want to read more on them there is a website that for a long time was maintained don't know if it is anymore", "3270": " called writer beware which was maintained by SIF WA the science fiction writers Association America where they would list a lot of things about why vanity presses were just not recommended a lot of them have have died off in the era of indie publishing there's still a bunch of them around but a lot of them have died off another warning sign is an agent who is asking for eternal revisions on your things without actually sending them out an agent who says you put your book out on submission but isn't willing to actually sit tell you the names of the editors they submitted to which imprints they're at and is not willing to send you the rejection letters that's a warning sign they should be willing to do all of this stuff an agent who asked for a lot of money up front bad the only thing an agent should ever charge you for is like sometimes postage right and even then my agent never charges any money he will take things out of what he sells like if he sends a bunch of books overseas it's part of our contract that he can charge the postage of that to me and that comes out of money that I've earned it's never more than a couple of hundred bucks a pay period and it's just like really minuscule and again I'm never paying any money it's coming out of other things so watch out for agents that are asking for money watch out for agents that are asking for reading fees watch out for agents who are too aren't who aren't publishing books right who up they don't publish but you know I mean who aren't selling books to legitimate publishers that you can find in the bookstore here's the bottom line if this publisher or person you want to work with if you can't go to Barnes & Noble and find their books on the Shelf not orderable but on the Shelf you don't need them you can do indie publishing and you can do everything that those people would do for you on your own and you probably should if you can go and find a book by a new they're picked up in the last couple of years on the shelves at Barnes & Noble already they're not have to be ordered in then chances are good that's the legitimate publisher slash agent if they represented that all right okay who how much time do we have left about 15 minutes all right so we are going to break down what happens when a book gets acquired all right and I'm gonna go fast through this part because we only have 15 minutes left because we got a bit of a late start show the book gets acquired this is great what happens is first there's an offer and this is usually of an advance an advance from a publisher is money up front that is a loan against the money that book is going to earn for you over time it is a loan that does not need to be paid back if the book does not earn enough money it is a loan that needs to be paid back if you do not deliver the book or something like that happens all right an advance will be offered usually advances for first-time authors are around 10k they range between 5 and 20 okay but last time I saw one of the polls that said what did", "3463": " you get on your first book it was around 10k so this is $10,000 up front it's a even a little bit worse than that because usually this 10k is split between half on signing and half on publication which means that you're going to get 5 K of that when you sign that contract once in a while it's 1/3 on signing 1/3 on turn in and acceptance of the book and 1/3 on publication sometimes it's even split by paperback so there's a fourth one 1/4 on publication of hardcover 1/4 on paper publishing a paper bag I think that's where mine are now because my advances have gotten so astronomically huge that the publisher wants to space them out as far as possibly possible how I do advances get um they can go all the way from here up to ten million um is about what you see that like the highest that you're saying for anyone except for the really big kind of rule breaking authors like the your JK Rowling's and stuff like that so it's anywhere in there how do they know what to offer on a book if it's by a new author well this is where as my agent puts it imaginary numbers come in not the actual mathematical sense but what will happen is the editor will go to the publisher and say I really like this book I think it's really good for our line we should publish it and the publisher sometimes working with the marketing director and other people depends on the on the the publisher the imprint will get back and say alright how much do you think it can make and the editor will say I put this sheet together it's called a P&L profit and loss sheet that assumes this book does as well as this other book that we published by a new author that's kind of similar and based on those imaginary numbers that we've made up I think we can offer $20,000 on this book and the publisher will be like great that's your negotiation negotiating that's like your high end you can start negotiations below if they're demanding more than that you need to come back and renegotiate with us sometimes that imaginary number will be like we've hit the zeitgeist we can offer up to a hundred day on this right or whatever they they just kind of decide now how they know partially about this is if the book has been up for what we call a", "3605": " bidding war this is if the agent gets a book that they think is really hot like wow this is fantastic this is by a new author everyone's gonna want this they will send it out to all the publishers and instead of what normally happens when you submit you submit to the a off publisher they have they take like six months to a year to review it and get back to you it's this really miserable wait it was 18 months I waited for launchers to come back to me instead the agent will say we're taking offers in two weeks we we expect this to sell really fast and suddenly everyone goes crazy like wow this agent has a fantastic book they all go read it the agents supply agents try to keep a good reputation because an agent have a good reputation for books in the past can't get away with this as easily they all read the book and let's say they all like it then they all get back and they start making their offers and then the agent goes back to them and says well these people offered 100k and that's you know we don't you know you've got to have to beat that and so this other they'll can't basically play them all off of each other and eventually arrive at a high number now there's some interesting things about advances you", "3673": " should know because they are money that you are going to be paying back out of your royalties it means that if your book sells the same number of copies that that a famous authors book sells you will generally make about the same amount of money as that famous author you'll make it on the back end instead of on the front end and these numbers do change slightly but a lot of publishing contract language is this has been the same for years and basically the percentages are around the same for everyone it's just how many books do you sell and so because of that you you are kind of insulated against this sort of if your book takes off you haven't just sold it for $10,000 if your book takes off and sells a million copies you're gonna make five million bucks on that book regardless if you are brand new author or not at least if you have an industry-standard contract which all the big publishers should be offering as boilerplate you should be making a certain percentage which I don't think we have time to talk about this week but we'll try to get in next week but one of the things to know what about advances the more money the publisher is paid upfront the more likely they are to be like man we need to push this book because we spent 200 grand on the advance for this and if we only sell 10,000 copies we're not gonna make our money back so we better give it a huge marketing campaign so generally the bigger your advance the better within reason there is one reason the sometimes it's bad to have a big advance and that is if you can magic two books one of which both of these books are gonna sell 50,000 copies one of these books they paid a $10,000 advance on and it sold 50,000 copies and so off of that the author's earning around 150 grand maybe 200 grand depending on paperback stuff like that whatever but you know fifty thousand in hardcover would be around usually three to four bucks a book this other book they paid two million dollars for it sells $50,000 $50,000 call assay here's where it seems like everyone is settling that this book is worth pushing them higher than this may not be a good idea because they all have instincts about what it'll sell it's all made-up instincts no one knows for sure what you'll sell but there is that little caveat that I know Joshua likes it when I put in there to mention why sometimes pushing the the advance astronomically high may not be a great idea but regardless this book has advanced has been made your agent negotiates generally you want to have a contract where you're selling more than one book you don't generally want to sell a dozen books because you want to be able to renegotiate but you also want them committed to trying to grow you as an author so for instance they offer it on launchers they offer ten thousand dollars for one book Joshua you know they offered $5,000 for a book Joshua got them argued up to twenty thousand dollars for two books so 10,000 per book for two different books and said let's go with this he feels like he could have taken it other places and got higher he still thinks that but since I'd already off I wanted to be a tour and I'd send it to tour already and I'm like I think we should be a tour I took a slightly lower advance than Joshua thought we probably could have gotten if we would have played the field a little bit more so the book has been negotiated all the terms get negotiated we'll talk about contracts next week and at that point you start working directly with the editor if it's not the acquisitions editor it's generally it's going to be the person who ended up negotiating for the book the most sometimes it's not sometimes gets handed off to a different editor either way this is the person that you're going to have a great relationship with hopefully this is the person who's the project manager for your book their job is to find out from you know talk with you about how to make the book better they always want to make a better version of the book you want to write remember that they bought your book they're not going to try to push to be something it's not okay they'll want to help you make it a better version of itself people ask do editors ask for things to be added only if they think it's going to make a better version of the book that you are trying to write they will make suggestions so always your job to make the changes and to decide if you want them or not at the end of the day you can always pay back the advance and cancel the contract if it doesn't end up working on that happens very rarely most of the time you work with the editor you give you you try the things they suggest some of the things they suggest you really like some you don't you come to a kind of consensus at the end of the book is now ready the editor meantime has been working with the art director to come up with a with a cover your cover is a movie poster for your book it is not an illustration of your book right so the art directors job is to come up with a cover that will get the right audience to pick up your book not to be detail accurate to what's in the book keep that in mind editor handles that they will show you sketches they usually will not let you have too much influence over the cover as a new author sometimes they will most of the time they won't at that point then they take it out and give it to their sales force the sales force takes it around and sells it to all the on the markets all the bookstores and says you should buy that carry this number of copies it's a really important cool book that we're releasing they come up with negotiations and deals and things like that about releasing the book into the stores and then they do publicity which is money they put into the authors tour and things like that and they do marketing which is money they put into convincing the book sellers to push the book and at that point your book gets released will do more questions about this on in two weeks because next week we'll do another publishing lecture and then we'll do a lot of your questions so students make sure you fill out the form make sure you write questions I didn't get to in that form and I'll try to get to it in two weeks next week we'll do indie publishing and contracts all right sorry about the fire hose guys sorry about the late start but keep going keep riding we'll see you again next week"}, "13": {"0": " hey everybody welcome to class uh this is our next to last class this will be another fire hose session i apologize for that but it is going to happen uh we will slow down next week for our last week where we will i will do q a on publishing questions from you so hold your questions um and then please write them into the forums that you are going to fill out saying that you were here for this session all right and i will use be using that list and last week's list to answer what you guys need to know um this week i want to thank in particular jennifer peale and becky monson um these two are the students i have this year who are professional romance novelists who took the class because they wanted to try something new and learn some fantasy and science fiction uh they're both indie published and they have been an enormous research source for preparing this lecture they were going to give this lecture in class but with social distancing and things like that we just decided to have them send me their notes um which i am going to incorporate into this lecture it's really handy to have notes from people who are doing it in the trenches right now so let's talk about indie publishing this week by the way our main topics will be indie publishing and then what contracts look like in traditional publishing along with royalties and things like that which will be comparing to how things work in indie publishing so brief and overly simplistic history of indie publishing back in the day if you wanted to be independently published it was really hard some people still did it and were successful uh famously the christmas box was an independent book back in the day aragon was a uh an indie book back before the um the big change ever happened in about 2010. uh but during these days most of the time indeed publishing was synonymous with what we call vanity publishing uh which the two are distinct but the line blurred a lot more back then vanity publishing would be you go to a press you pay a bunch of money you are your book is published but you get five thousand copies which you store in your garage and occasionally give away or maybe sell i had somebody who was a friend of my parents when i was growing up who had done this um they were a newscaster who had a story about a golfer they wanted to tell they wrote it they got it vanity published and then they sold three or four hundred copies of the five thousand copy print run that they paid for and the other five thousand copies sat in their garage um this was unfortunately the um the average story for someone who tried to indie publish back in the day the problem being that warehousing shipping and distributing physical medium is really hard and requires a lot of connections or a lot of fame or your own model the people who are most successful with indie publishing back before the digital revolution were people who had a way to sell their books themselves for instance they were giving lectures or seminars on something and they would have their book for sale there they will have indie publish their book and then would sell it there or they were someone who you know sold at an expo doing something else and also had a guidebook on the thing that they were doing i knew somebody who you know sold alpacas in alpaca wool who had indie published their book which was a fantasy novel about talking alpacas and sold it at their same booth these sort of things could be successful but for many years it was really hard and because of that it also picked up quite a bit of stigma uh stigma which was likely undeserved then and is very undeserved now that indie publishing was not real publishing um well something happened in 2010 um the digital revolution finally hit books now this was a long time coming and long enough coming that people were uncertain if it ever would actually hit books because it had hit music it was hitting television and film people were moving to digital for things like music but people resisted that and continued to want print books um and then uh the kindle launched and in the space of the year the whole landscape changed it like everyone had been waiting and holding their breath and they'd started to think well maybe and then it just it all came rushing through so what happened is uh you can actually i could see it on my royalty statements my royalty statements went from a handful of ebook copies being sold the air just tiny numbers you know earnings and they're like your ebook earnings this uh this quarter were 53 dollars to suddenly 20 to 30 percent of my business moving uh digital in one year uh this was a huge revolution in the industry um it has continued over the years though ebook versus print has stabilized across the last three years or so with the only growth segment of of it being audiobooks right now audiobooks are still growing print and ebook meaning audiobooks is still swallowing a bit of the print and ebook percentages whereas print and ebook have hit about a stasis now this is going to vary widely depending on your genre for instance books for middle grade readers sell far fewer ebook and audiobooks than print books whereas big long books tend to do better in digital formats and in audiobook formats this is because the um number one they get hard to hold um and number two because of an audible subscription method one credit buys you a book whether it's 55 hours worth of listening or nine hours worth of listening and people tend to save their credits for the very big books so the longer your book is generally that is an advantage particularly in audiobook but also to an extent in ebooks and the more tech savvy and likely to have digital devices your audience the more likely it is to move to ebook and then kind of the third thing factor here is how fast of a page turner it is so this kind of fights with the length a lot of the best page trainers are shorter books but those tend to the ones that when you finish it you immediately want the next one just really quickly want to be able to click the link and say all right i'm going to read the next one i still have a few hours left tonight before i have to go get up and go to work i'm going to read this book and so these three factors kind of push things right now with my latest book being skyward sequel um starsight star site was only 17 print okay it was 83 audiobook and digital book um in its opening weeks i haven't seen the final breakdown this was just you know the first two months um and of those audiobook it was the first book of mine that audiobook was larger than the um than the e-book numbers i believe so", "448": " this is a big revolution and in 10 years we have gone from less than one percent digital in my royalties to only 17 print this transfer was offered a lot of opportunities to the indie published authors um and this revolution meant that the indie published authors could do a lot of the work that the big publishers were doing and did not have to deal with distribution chains warehousing and things like this and today indie publishing is almost exclusively ebook and audiobook now you will generally as an any published author have your books up for print sale but they are usually print on demand with very small royalty rates just there so that people want print copies can buy them and put them on their shelves most of the time you're not making very much money off of that print on demand because you know it costs like 19 bucks to print a copy and you sell it for 20 or something like that um probably a bit lower than that you're probably printing it for like 12 and selling at 15 or but people just aren't buying a ton of those and the the printing costs are expensive and so most of your sales will be digital indie published what happened in 2010 that really started driving this is a few authors um in particular some romance authors and some thriller authors who are writing fast-paced um what we would have once called pulp genre fiction which means it's very solidly incited genre like it's it's romance with a capital r focused on the romance that is shorter and faster paced um usually in some sort of series sometimes in romance the author's name becomes the series uh this happens um in that genre same thing in thrillers often you know dan brown thriller is a genre rather than them all being about one character but sometimes they are a lot of dan browns are for instance a lot of john grisham's or not um but either way fast-paced shorter books real page turner's priced cheaply um we're talking books for three four or five dollars that people could immediately click on the next one at the end of buying one and just says click here to buy the next one and they would just rip through these and the indie publishing market just exploded uh to the point that you can find percentages but there is a significant i i don't have these numbers offhand i didn't look them up but often it's something like 40 percent of what's being sold on on amazon is independently published which is a huge huge chunk of the market now let's point out that jk rowling is a not insignificant number of that forty percent she's like two or three percent by herself uh because she kept all the digital rights to harry potter for the audiobooks and the e-books and she self-publishes them um so", "629": " jumping back to jennifer and becky here um they are excellent examples of um authors who are doing very well um i asked them just so i could let you guys know that they weren't just starving artists for uh some ballpark numbers so uh this isn't them bragging this is me pushing them to uh to let you know but jennifer has published 30 books so far she makes six figures you can find uh her books in a lot of local physical media at bookstores um and she's won numerous awards uh becky has published seven books makes high five figures in a year she has an agent and has a movie deal on one of her books so i would recommend you check out their books um they're both great writers i have read quite a bit of their writing in the class so far and so i would recommend that you uh you give them a look and uh thank you jennifer and becky who are watching uh for this now i'm going to kind of go down their list of reasons why you would independently publish um in today's market and", "695": " um this is kind of a contrast to the traditional publishing model we talked about last week and then i'll start getting into some actual numbers and contracts and looking at what some of the numbers look like uh so they say that their number one reason is flexibility um so independently publishing if you are indie published one of the things you can do is you can target the market much faster and better you also are flexible in how you publish um you're flexible in determining um you know how long your series is how long your book is you are your soul you are in charge of all of this and underneath this i would say equal to this is uh according to some things they said is control um so as an indie author you decide what goes", "745": " on the cover review book you decide what goes on the back summary of your book you decide the pricing of your book you decide when something is up for sale you decide when it's not up for sale you decide what promotions you want to be part of these things are really uh powerful reasons to to independently publish um if you are really worried that your book is going to have a terrible cover that you have no control over then indie publishing will look better to you because as a new author generally you have very little say over what goes on the cover of your book or what goes on the back flap of your book if you are really worried about the idea of selling your book in perpetuity most contracts these days for print rights are for life of copyright when you sign a deal to sell a book to tor for instance you are selling that book for your lifetime plus 70 years to be published by them under that contract there are ways to get that back but that is what you're signing up for a lot of the other contracts are different a lot of audiobook contracts for instance are like for seven years or something like that a lot of overseas rights are for like seven to nine years but u.s and i believe yeah us i'm not sure about uk i might have to look that up but us print uh rights are for life of copyright almost all the time and in fact i have never found someone who got them to budge on that at a at a top string publisher that's just one of the things that they know is a line in the sand so um flexibility control um the other is they put money um when you are self-publishing you keep the lion's share of the money uh", "855": " what is usually happening is there's a 30 70 split uh with a 70 going to the author um in most cases where you'll be publishing the place the platform you're putting it up on will take around thirty percent and you will make around seventy percent of whatever you set as the price uh we will put the caveat that amazon requires those to be um between three and ten dollars 299 to 999 to get that royalty anything below or above that gets a much worse royalty and basically nobody does it um so you keep the lion's share of that money", "890": " uh as you can you can see it will run some of these numbers later if you have a small but dedicated fan base that is willing to buy whatever you sell you could theoretically let's say you published with a with a new york publisher and with them you're going to sell about 10 000 copies and on your own you're going to sell about 10 10 000 copies well that is an excellent reason to independently publish if they cannot sell you a lot more copies than you would sell if you've targeted targeted niche market you know that market really well and you're going to be selling to them then new york will do nothing for you you will make much more independently published if you also are really good at releasing things according to trends quickly writing and writing things that are good page turners and in long serial format any publishing's flexibility would allow you to do some things i would recommend you look up someone called bella forest uh bella forest is i believe the best selling in the author on amazon she might have been replaced by someone else but usually she is and bella forest model is that she releases um books that are similar to current trends in publishing she jumps on them much faster and then she releases long serialized stories about them her biggest series is the shade of vampire and this is a series that is very similar to twilight romantic urban fantasies with vampires there are something like 50 entries she releases a new one like every six weeks um and she sells tons of copies uh she is often kind of chasing at jk rowling and some of those right underneath them at like number three or four author on all of amazon uh recently i've looked and she's dropped down like number 10 or 12 or 15 but she has you know she has other things that feel a lot like hunger games she has other things that feel you know like nicholas sparks books basically and she's releasing a book every two weeks um and", "1015": " that flexibility um and that speed of publishing is just not something you can do in traditional publishing it just does not work um so one thing they wanted to point out is that you can get everything a print book it's or a trad pup um so by this i mean sorry about that terrible handwriting guys by this what they mean is if you want to get your books in bookstores you can make it happen it does happen it's harder um if you want movie deals it can happen generally harder but it can happen um for instance the emperor's soul that i released i independently published the ebook um and i went through a uh a small press a regional press called tachyon for the print book and they did a fantastic job on the print book and got it into every book store in the country and we got a movie deal offer on that that was an indie um it was a hybrid but uh i did a lot of the indie publishing for that myself um you can get they write um into the major bookstores you can get movie deals pointing out that the martian was indy published which indeed it was um you can get book signings you can get teaching speaking engagements and teaching opportunities um so those are your arguments for self-publishing and they are legit um if you watching this retain any sort of bias against vanity press or things like that because of the way the industry has talked about it you should abandon those very quickly this is a realistic and in fact um a growing uh segment of the market and it is something that you should seriously consider as a writer right now trying to break in uh so let's talk a little bit about how one breaks in to indie publishing um so", "1145": " i have generally and they talk about these things a little bit so i'll try to write up their notes a little bit later i've generally heard two general schools generally general i've heard of two general schools of thought about breaking into indie publishing um school of thought number one is this idea of becoming what is called a platform writer a platform writer which i think is mostly my term for it others might call it something else is somebody who has a really great platform that draws a lot of attention and they use that as publicity to market their novels uh larry korea is generally held up as a poster child for this larry curry if you're not familiar with him is an avid gun nut um he is um a right uh wing um commentator and things like this and loves his gun rights um issues and he broke in right before the big indie publishing thing took off by indy publishing on his own by running a blog where he talked about all his gun uh all the stuff he finds fascinating about guns and politics and then he wrote books um which accurately used it used firearms used i accurately used firearms and people who knew their way around firearms as a contrast to a lot of the media he was reading where people just didn't know what they were doing and so if you wanted to read an action adventure story with people who knew their way around guns and who presented the world in a way that larry korea's um you know fan base would really enjoy then these were perfect books for you he then had his blog to kind of funnel attention toward this he was active on a lot of gun forums and said hey you know you guys know me um i've been participating for years here i've got a good reputation here is my book maybe check it out that funneled a lot of attention toward his books and turned them into best sellers even before he got picked up by a traditional publisher which he eventually did he eventually um he picked bane which is kind of a almost it's like a traditional uh big publisher but works like a small press it's kind of an interesting case but anyway um there are still a lot of people who are platform writers um talking to a lot of indie writers recently they have said that platform writing is very hard to cut through the noise on and they recommend method number two unless you have some really good platform already or something you know really well and are good at writing blog posts and stuff and that is the publish as much as you can as quick as you can model they say that your next book is usually the best piece of marketing you can make for your previous book this stands in traditional publishing as well it is a good rule of thumb that generally making sure your next book is coming out in a timely way is more valuable to you as a marketing tool than anything else you could be doing with that time once you have that book coming out and you have extra time that's when you add on doing all the other stuff the going on the social media sites um the doing guest posts on other people's blogs people won't read blogs anymore but you know that sort of thing um all of this is secondary to making sure the next book comes out and if you're indie published that may mean your next book that you're releasing in four months it might mean the next book you're releasing in a year it depends on your publishing schedule um so", "1358": " what do you do um they recommend the following and i'm not going to write these all up because some of these are a bit longer they recommend joining joining online groups and forums like 20 books to 50k uh these groups provide a wealth of knowledge into the indie publishing world go ask people who are into polishing right now where they found their information i can't give it to you because i exist in a very different realm from this that even when i indie publish i have a platform and the platform is that i'm a well-known and reputable fantasy writer already with the marketing budget of a big five press behind me um attend conferences run specifically for indie authors or which include indie authors like story makers story makers is a local convention here to utah it is fantastic one of the best conventions i have ever attended uh point number three you must run it like a business you must be willing to put in hours and invest money we'll talk about that in a minute uh you must write a killer book or more than one before you release rapid release can be your friend it gives you more ways to market uh so what's hap what happens a lot in the publishing i've seen right now is this this blitz method um i have a good friend who sometimes has has uh taught in the class before uh jancy um and jancy has done this thing with a co-author recently that i see commonly happening in the publishing which is where they spend several years writing like 12 books in a series and then what they do is they save those all up and they release them in a blitz one a month for a year you might be saying i don't have any idea how bella forest can release a book every two weeks i don't know either no idea what's going on over there but i do know that a lot of my friends would not be capable of releasing a book a month but they can take three years and write 12 books and then blitz with a book a month for a year so that each one is building on the previous ones either way quick releases do tend to be very advantageous in indie publishing", "1484": " do everything you to make sure it doesn't look like an indie book uh this is their their next point this is really important this is the one where most people um mess up you need a really good cover and you have to pay for a good cover uh when i've indie published we're usually spending a couple grand on a cover you don't even have to do that but you do have to be spending good money um i've heard that you can get a decent cover for 500 um but you don't want to be doing the covers that cost five bucks bucks off of fiverr you just they will look really really cheap um you want to be paying for editing and helpfully um this is information i didn't have jennifer and becky have included what the rates are that uh that people charge so let me write these up on the board so you have them and you can write them down so rates that people charge make sure that it's not one okay uh so for a copy edit i'll explain these in a second you are looking at point zero zero seven through point zero zero nine cents a word um um content editing you are looking for uh looking at around uh 1.2 cents to 1.25 oh sorry um 0.0125 uh dollars um a word and proofreading is around point zero zero three uh a word so apologize again about my handwriting uh but basically these are these are rates um that you'll be looking for uh paying by word uh a copyedit is kind of like a continuity edit con this is where a copyright is like a better proofread where they will also kind of look at style guide sort of things and try to apply a style guide if you have one if you're like make this look like you know chicago manual style or whatever um or watch out for if a character you know eyes are one color in one scene and a different color next scene copy editors kind of catch that stuff um content editing is like an editor who's giving you substantive feedback about the plot characters pacing these sorts of things and proofreading is just the only looking for typos uh when uh my uh editorial director peter does proofreads and copy edits he often reads the book backward uh we'll be just so that he's not focusing on content type stuff he's only looking at at the words and things like this but um yeah you need this stuff you need to be paying for editing you need to be paying for a cover um you may want to have to you may want to pay someone to lay out your book for you um this makes certain means it looks aesthetically pleasing on the page if your ebook only you don't have to worry about this nearly as much because people resize the font and things like that and so the layout on the page is much easier for a lot of ebooks so they say search the internet and ask in groups and forums about how authors find good freelance editors and cover artists um so uh just to kind of quickly um talk a little bit about well let's let's actually go to um talk about the nuts and bolts of how you self-publish and then we're going to talk about the nuts and bolts of traditional publishing looking at contracts and then if there's time we'll talk about what they've written about advertising and branding which can be basically the same regardless of which way you're going so um they suggest there are um there are", "1715": " two main methods there is the go wide method or the amazon exclusive method so what they're meaning here is if you are willing to sign up for amazon exclusively you get a better deal um generally um they put you on kindle unlimited which is the kind of subscription service on amazon where people subscribe to it pay a monthly uh fee and then they amazon pays you based on the number of words they're read this can be really helpful for a lot of indie authors because a lot of traditional published authors are not in that so you are competing only against you know people who are in that program um but it works well for romance fantasy and mystery genres um people who are going to want to rip through an entire series sometimes going exclusively on kindle can be good for you going wide means you're putting it not just on amazon but on all the different platforms uh which can give you a wider net but a slightly worse deal and not quite as good of marketing uh from amazon amazon uh they can um so uh if you choose to go wide you can use platforms like to digital to upload your manuscript and they will distribute it to barnes noble ibooks kobo amazon etc but always upload to amazon yourself it's easy and gives you more control and more money this is what we have found as well indie publishing my books that's how we do it so on amazon your price must be 299 to 9.99 uh don't price it anything above that you can sometimes go lower than that and price your first book at 99 cents you'll get a terrible royalty because it's 30 you'll get like 35 cents a book um because you get a 35 royalty on a dollar but for a while giving away your first book for free or cheap was a method to get people reading the series readers have kind of come wise to this and it happens it's it works a little less now than it used to it used to be the kind of the silver bullet put your first book up for free than the rest series then amazon stopped liking people doing that and they stopped letting them put them up for free and would give them periods where they could be free and so people started charging at 99 cents and you would have to ask the current indie authors um what uh jennifer and becky say um be careful how you price your books and train your audience if you train them to get your ebooks for free or 99 cents from the beginning they will expect that of your future books um paperbacks um just do through their self-publishing thing until you get big enough where you may want to do a small print run of your own and sell them at conventions and things it's not a huge part but they say it's useful for getting t into particularly your local bookstores which you can do if you have enough sales and you have print books that you can give to one of the distributors to put through um they make two notes at the", "1880": " end here which i think are really smart notes uh one of them is that there are a lot of scams out there for trying to prey upon indie authors there are a ton of these and one of the best things you can do is remember that um be very skeptical of anyone asking you for money now this doesn't include obviously you're paying people for cover and for editing and things like that but be very skeptical if someone says i will do all the work for you just give me this much money a lot of those are scams not all of them but a lot of them a lot of them are vanity presses which you don't need these days because you can do this yourself the other thing they mentioned is that landscape is constantly changing and that you need to keep up to date on it and yes you do one of the big changes i've talked about this a little bit uh before in class but one of the big changes is amazon over the last couple of years has become a pay to play location wrong turn market meaning that amazon charging authors uh to advertise their books on amazon has become a major source of income for amazon and in the beginnings of the indie book revolution it was all all of amazon's recommendations were based solely on what did people who read this book also like you went to a brandon sanderson book page they would serve you ads only for books that people who bought my book then bought another book and really liked it and rated both of them highly and it didn't matter to amazon if you were indie if you were if you were traditionally published they were simply looking to sell you the best book they could to keep you reading books i think it is a mistake and short-sighted of amazon but recently they have shrunk and contracted that recommendation system and greatly expanded the an author paid to be on this page recommendation system if you go to the way of kings right now you will find the similar books that other people liked thing on there for a while they'd moved that all the way to the bottom now they moved it back up but you also find an advertisement on the page this right to the the right of my book that is paid to be there you will often find a banner ad for something that is paid to be there and then you also find sponsored books um in a big long list paid to be on this page and asking jennifer and becky they um nowadays are paying thousands of dollars a month on advertising on amazon in order to keep selling books basically this 70", "2030": " royalty looks a lot worse than it used to when you're you're having to invest 35 or 50 percent 35 you're investing 50 percent of what you make back into pay amazon to advertise your book and if you don't they just don't appear on anyone's pages you don't sell them i think this is terrible for indie publishing i think it's terrible for books in general but it is what amazon has decided to do now and they are the big player in the market they are something like 80 of all ebooks um and so if you're going to be independently published you either are going to have to have a platform that is driving people to those books pages you're going to have to somehow get popular enough that people are looking for them directly or you're gonna have to pay amazon thousands of dollars to advertise them in order to keep selling books um and this is i think very unfortunate but it is the way the world works right now double check me on that by talking to other indie authors i've asked five or ten and this is the answer they've given me but i might be getting an unrepresented a disproportionately represented um say segment of the market who is um who is paying a lot for ads and having that work and so they're continuing to do it maybe there are other ways maybe it's uh this probably this ad payment has a has a ceiling on it so once you get to a certain amount of ad spend then you make more and more so once you hit that threshold it becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of your take um but be aware that that is part of the market right now all right let's talk about um contracts uh how much time do we have left i don't have a clock in here minutes 40 minutes great", "2130": " all right we're going to talk contracts sorry again about the fire hose um let's jump over to traditional publishing because talking about contracts and your take here can kind of help you compare and contrast indie publishing right now and i'm going to switch markers because i think this one was writing better all right so in publishing a lot of the royalty rates are fairly standardized so in traditionally publishing in traditional publishing here's what you're looking at almost all books have um between 10 and 15 i said between 10 and 10. uh of cover for hardcover almost all of them have between six and eight percent of cover for paperback and all of them have around 10 of cover for um uh trade paper all right i'll explain this to you so all the the print formats are based on a cover price calculation uh these stretch back decades maybe over a century that basically whatever the publisher charges for that book they are going to pay to you a percentage of that once they get it in it does not matter what the book actually sells for so for instance usually bookstores are getting the books at around fifty percent off if they decide then that this twenty dollar book that they are going to sell for twelve dollars to put it on sale that is them deciding to make a profit of two dollars instead of ten dollars on your book they are still paying ten dollars to the publisher and out of that the publisher is still paying you ten to fifteen percent of the cover price of that initial twenty dollars as a royalty payment to you for every copy sold uh for the same thing for paperback six to eight percent same thing for trade paperback trade paperbacks are the oversized hardcover size paperbacks whereas when they say paperback we mean the pocket edition these are the u.s royalty rates uh they vary a little bit um in the uk so basically what's going on here is these you're like how do i determine if i get the 10 or the 15 almost every contract i've gotten had a break point of something like this 10 on the first 5k 12 and a half second 5k and then 15 after on the hardcover um so what this means is um if i sell 100 000 copies and you sell 100 000 copies we probably both have a very similar thing in the hardcover um thing we both make the same amount of money this is pretty nice um this is this is good to know that there isn't a lot of room here now there are rumors of people getting more uh the the most i've ever heard is that uh the rumor and i don't have this information so i could be wrong that lucasarts was getting 22 percent of hardcover on their star wars books from uh from del rey or who it was one of the random house imprints that was printing them for years um i don't know if that's true um i've never met an author personally who got higher than this without doing a drastically different deal with the publisher um there are drastically different deals where you profit share and instead take an advance you take a larger chunk of the percentage later on stephen king famously has this as rumored to have this i don't know stephen king's contracts as one of his deals and i do profit share with some of my publishers as well basically no advance higher royalties were kind of co-publishing at that point that sort of thing um but generally what you can change are in your negotiations these break points usually they don't change these percentages as much as they change the break points like for instance some of my um some of my teen books the break points were like you know first 10k or something um and then you know you shrink that same thing here like um i think my ebook started at like six percent for the first 75 or my my paperback six percent for the first 75 000 and like eight percent thereafter for some reason seven percent almost never shows up but it's one of those weird things um and trade tends to like i've seen it like you know fluctuate just by a percentage point or two but basically this is what you're getting this is a fair deal um you may say wow i only get 15 percent of that do remember that you're really making more than that because this is retail so about half is going to the retail establishment so on a a 20 book the publisher is um is getting ten dollars back and you are generally getting on that 250 so you're taking about 25 of what the publisher is making that could go higher but considering the way that they take risks up front this tends to be a fairly fair model which is why it's been negotiated over decades and has landed where it does what hasn't been negotiated for decades in fact only been negotiated for around a decade is where the ebook and audiobook royalties will end up landing and so ebook and audiobook", "2460": " are different they are calculated on net that should scare you a ton but fortunately the net is very clearly defined um and does not include costs net on ebook and audiobook is defined by what the publisher gets from the um then you selling them this is usually 25 of net where net means the 70 um of actual price that the publisher gets so what does that mean well let's say that the publisher the book is sold on amazon for ten dollars the publisher is taking getting seventy percent of that the same percentage that the indie book author is making then they are paying 25 of what they actually got to the author if this goes on sale then then your percentage shrinks it's no longer paid on cover all right so that's a very big difference this number um is starting to stabilize it is too low um a lot of industry advocates and author advocates have pointed out that this if you i'm not going to run all the numbers for you right now that this really should be somewhere around 35 percent probably or even a little higher because the publisher if you run all the the numbers which you don't have time for the publisher is making more off of each ebook sold than they make off the print book and you are making around the same they are taking a slightly higher higher percentage cut a higher net cut at the end than they need to be taking these i haven't seen this get negotiated up because a lot of authors have what are called most favored nations clauses what this means is if one author gets it negotiated up the other authors who have most favored nation clauses all should automatically get it as a matter of legal requirement in their contract so publishers have been very very resistant to change this basically to change that number you have to do some sort of profit share or something like that which requires give and takes from you but giving up advances and things like that that's been my experience your mileage may vary it could change in the future and there may be people out there who have negotiated different deals than we've been able to this is kind of where it sits in audio 25 of net though i have this one has been more negotiable i've gotten as high as around 40 percent um i've met with certain uh book publishers um this has started to stabilize back at the 25 and has been going down with the advances going up um but um that's not necessarily a bad thing because a lot of these audio contracts are for seven years and so if your exam your advance gets sky high your percentage goes down it is possible for an advance to get so high that it effectively gives you a higher royalty let's talk about that um oh there seems to be confusion in the chat between indian self-publishing they are the same we use both of those terms okay indian self-publishing are the same the only thing is different is vanity publishing which basically doesn't exist in its same form anymore and you should ignore it um indeed indian self-publishing uh words for the same thing um so you also ask about small presses i'll talk about small presses if we have time um all right so advances all right", "2660": " so remember this is all against an advance that you get up front so i'll try not to spend too much on the boring numbers here this stuff is interesting to me i know it might bore some of you but let's say on your audiobook you get paid a million dollar advance right and the audiobook publisher has looked and figured out across the seven year life of the term that you are going to under a standard royalty earn around 800k right for that 25 percent of that they've figured it out they aren't giving you a higher royalty but by offering you that one million they're basically giving you a higher royalty because they're giving you 200 000 extra and you could run the numbers and basically since that license is going to run out in seven years anyway you don't have to pay back the extra money they all ran the numbers it is possible for a book to not earn out earning out is where your royalties match the amount they gave you up front and still be successful this is how a lot of very powerful authors a lot of the politicians for example uh and celebrities get sky-high advances higher than sales would indicate their royalty should earn but because the price per copy is down so much and because um the the the book is going to sell enough copies they can effectively give the author a higher royalty rate without changing the royalty rate in the contract deciding what the right advance is for a book is a very difficult and process that involves a lot of guesswork so most of the time you want your advance to be of a size where you're going to earn that out in a couple of years um usually i look for them like do you earn this back off of the hard cover and like two years of the paperback run um if so pretty good advance that's about you know what you're looking to get sometimes it's it's viable to get higher than that only if your book is going to go to astronomical highly high sales numbers but let's just kind of look at this um number wise uh to kind of compare to indie publishing um and i did run these numbers earlier so i can write them out exactly um", "2800": " we talked about keeping a larger percentage of the cut one of the other things that indie publishing is very good at doing is undercutting the markets because they have more money to work with now slowly what's happening more money to work was the wrong term they have more uh flexibility on pricing what has happened over time is traditional publishing has pushed their prices higher and higher in the e-book market um this is because they have a different deal with amazon amazon gives them a better deal they get the 70 percent even if they go over 9.99 you don't get that deal i'm sorry amazon doesn't offer it to us to me when i indie publish they do offer it to the publishers a stormlight archive book costs 17 ebook this is not a bad thing i actually wish that ebook pricing fluctuated more based on the length of the books i have pushed my publishers to charge less for my shorter books and more for my larger books they haven't always listened to me on this but i i think it is kind of um i know it's the way the industry works but i think it's not a good way for the industry work to work that the longer the the longer books do not increase in price this pushes authors to release these very quick short books where you actually get less value for your book and i think it would be better if everyone's like you know a stormlight archive book is somewhere around eight times as long as some of these short books that are being published in a series that you are paying three dollars a piece for well eight times three would be twenty four dollars is what the stormlight archive book should cost we charge 17. uh i think that's a fair price um i know some people online are like why is this one 17 when someone else's is three well it's 400 000 word book um that said traditional publishing is not good on varying this length i wish that they would charge a lot cheaper for the hundred thousand word books and a lot more for the big books and they don't um they tend to vary like i looked up a book that is half the length of a stormlight book and it's 13 so yes it's cheaper but not significantly according to percentage this is all kind of neither here nor there if you look at the indie published authors books a lot of them will be priced 299 399 or 4.99 if we take that author whose book is 13 who's uh a pretty i'm not going to say the name but a pretty solid midlister kind of top of the midless uh fantasy novelist their their book is selling for 13 as an ebook right well if um you have your standard royalty that i talked about earlier that author is making two dollars and around 25 cents per copy that is sold by the publisher if you're indie published you can charge if your book is three dollars you are making around a two dollar profit so if your book is four dollars you're making a better profit um than the traditional published author on a book that is one-third the price this is where the power of indie authors is manifest and then being able to charge a reasonable but low price for their books undercutting the traditional published market this kind of creates this dichotomy where traditional publishing is moving more toward more expensive books that are prestige books that are by well-known authors there is a reason why someone like andy weir who self-published was very successful eventually decided to go traditionally published and you do see a lot of the people who break out the midlist going to traditional publishers because they can demand a whole bunch from them these days a lot of the mid-listing does work way better in these numbers as an indie author um that said as an indie author you have to be willing to run the business all yourself and do all these things up front one of the main reasons you would go traditionally publish instead of india published is number one you have a big enough name or enough expected sales or a book that is hitting the market at just the right time in order to demand a very large advance and to demand a lot of marketing push from the publisher another reason to go traditionally published is that doing it all yourself is just not something you want to do um this sounds like i have a good friend who's like i i know i could do all this i just don't want to that's not what i want to spend my life doing i want to she says be sending books to a publisher working with an editor letting them handle all the cover art and things like that and release the book that is a good reason to go traditionally published it is a lot of work to even traditionally publish india publishing is even more work another reason to go traditionally published would be if you want to see your book in all bookstores across the nation uh indie publishing there are very few who are able to get books in all print stores usually you can get them regionally to your local stores but getting them into bookstores all around the country and all around the world uh very hard to do as an any published author um not impossible but very hard to do and if you want to be able to walk into a bookstore and find your book on the shelf and you probably want to be traditionally published then another reason to be traditionally published is if you are writing in a genre that does not lend itself well to the things that are selling well in indie books uh i often use um a book like the doomsday book um as an example of this uh connie willis it's a fantastic science fiction writer who does a ton of research for her books and writes basically time travel books with exhaustively researched historical periods where people from a future society go back to a historical period these books are long they're in depth she only releases one every four or five years if that often and they win a lot of awards and um they deserve them she would be poorly placed in the indie publishing market because she releases books so infrequently that she needs the doesn't need it but it's better to have the publisher pushing the book to get a wider pickup by libraries and schools and to win awards and to have that drive the sales between you know the five years that she's releasing a new book that's an author who's served much better by traditionally pub being traditionally published uh 20 minutes great um so let's break and talk briefly about marketing and self-promotion and then maybe get to a few of these questions which are popping up on the screen that i can no longer see so that is good all right so let's get to the last part of what uh becky and uh jennifer um", "3220": " put here which is advertising and branding they note you still have to do a lot of this even when traditionally published especially for first-time authors and yes you do so one of the advantages of being traditionally published is you get to take advantage of their distribution chain this means that you have a lot of people going to the various bookstores and convincing them to carry copies of your book for a new author that does not have a particularly large advance this is basically all the publicity you will get they're not going to buy a lot of advertising maybe a little bit they're not going to spend a lot of money on amazon advertising they're not going to spend a lot of money on facebook advertising they'll spend a little bit but not a ton of advertising those things unless your book is considered like the big release by a new author that they're pushing very hard because of this you with a smaller advance often have to do a lot of this yourself what they recommend doing is social media pages again this shouldn't take precedent over finishing your next book in my opinion but having a social media and a website presence is good if you can maintain it here's the thing a webpage that that has that never updates but has a blog on it that has you know if you go to this website and say in the last post that was posted is three years old that is worse than having no blog on your website better to have a static page that just has your book and um sample chapters throwing that around and things like that than it is to have something that doesn't update same with your your twitter your facebook they mentioned by the way that facebook and instagram works for them and twitter doesn't work much for them anymore uh i know other people have been very successful with twitter but uh you're gonna have to you know pick some social media platforms and do a good job with them uh this can be tricky because a lot of people aren't looking for a marketing feed in their uh their twitter feed they already get a lot of advertisements from the big companies if your twitter feed looks just like a marketing feed then your twitter feed is perhaps not going to be that useful to you uh same with your facebook and things you have to dedicate time to actually making that a place where people want to go and uh and discover things now if you have a fan base if you're starting to grow one posting about your life that can do it um and and things like that but just be aware that a twitter feed that just lists when your book is on sale probably going to be of no use to you um have a professional website yes have a website that looks professional and if you're not going to update it often make it look nice without you know a date saying when things were posted um this is one of the best things you can do uh for for your for your time is just have a good website so when people google you like some of you might google jennifer and becky you land on their page and can find out about their books um they suggest blogger bloggers and blog tours um i have no realistic understanding of how valuable these are a lot of people do them where they all share posts on different people's blogs this is a very common practice it really got popular after i had broken in and i don't know how useful it is the fact that they mentioned here means it probably is at least somewhat useful and people continue to do it uh this is where you write a really good blog post for someone else's blog that they can post that'll be of high value to their readers that'll make their blog a destination that people want to visit um and so they go and read about you your post and also about your book lending you their uh um their audience um how you do those by the way is by making contacts at conventions and things like that and having a good blog of your own so that you can say hey go look this is the sort of thing i do do you do blog exchanges would uh you let me do a guest post for you on your blog about x you know give them a proposal say i could do a really great blog post for your audience about this thing that would they'd be really interested in i don't know if larry does these for instance but you know if you were indie published and going to larry and say i know about you know these new assault rifles i've shot them out on the front lines i can do a really great post about how awesome they are maybe someone like larry would let you do a blog post i don't know again but that's the sort of thing we're looking at uh paid advertisements we talked about those author cross promotion uh basically um doing events with other authors particularly when you're new i have found to be very effective when i was new in my career book signings were almost useless but a book signing where three of us got together were way better because if each of us drew like five people then we had at least a respectable audience and plus we were kind of cross promoting to each other's audiences that point and a lot of people bought all three books so um build an email list uh let me emphasize this one um email lists tend to be your best uh marketing tool as long as your email list is a good one that you're not spamming people with it that you're you know if you're only gonna write like four blog posts a year you may be better off having a newsletter than a blog and just doing a really good newsletter that people are interested in signing up for and having because you know this is like a blog that's a little more personal and generally email lists have the best click-through rate because people have opted into them of any sort of advertising that you can do a lot of people in industry say email list is your your number one thing to do even before some of your social media um this all goes for uh for publishing and traditional as well the only thing that you will add is they will be spending some money not much um but some money uh advertising they will also be doing what is called co-op where they're offering the bookstores a little more money in order to put your book in nice places in the bookstore if you walk into a barnes noble and you see all those nice books for sale at the front of the bookstore that's all advertising space they don't just imagine you know say oh we'll put this one out it's new no the publisher has gone and said if you put this one on your octagon at the front of your barnes noble we will let you keep instead of 50 of what you sell you can have 55 um and they make all these kind of negotiations and deals bookstores do generally have a few discretionary locations where they can build an end cap or something so if you do a book signing there they might put your books on the end cap which is the end of the shelf um and things like that but a lot of that space is sold to publishers um and that's why they end up there so that's all advertising space everything but just basically being on the shelves even a lot of times if you see a little thing that says hey if you like this you might like this shelf talker is what they call them a lot of those are paid for not at the indie bookstores but a lot of the barnes and nobles and things those are those are things that they are kind of cooperative they call it publishing agreement with the publisher where they're both trying to sell more books and the bookstore gets to keep a little bit more of the money in exchange for that um the last thing they will do is they might send you on book tour uh book tour um book tours are weird in that bookstores do not make money um you can just run the numbers a really great uh book signing like the the biggest book signings i get um when i'm on tour maybe a thousand people that'd be amazing right george can pull around two thousand it's george martin i've heard of celebrities like the biggest book signing i asked one of the bookstores i went to that they ever had was ozzy osbourne um when at the height of the osborne's and he had like nine thousand um but let's say you do one of my book signings and it's a thousand people of those thousand people statistically around ten percent of them will buy the book and ninety percent of them will already have the book um and so the signing if you can if you magically could make it so that all 100 people that went to that book signing are people that wouldn't have bought it otherwise but bought it because of the book signing then what is the book signing done it has sold 100 extra books which equates to earnings for an author on the 15 thing for a round is going to be like 300 to 400 that might sound good to you but for an entire day's work where you have to fly somewhere where you have to be put up in a hotel where you often have to have drivers or media escorts whose job is to get you around it can cost three or four grand to put an author on tour for a day depending on the author um and even the publisher selling an extra hundred books making an extra what is that ten dollars a book they're making a thousand bucks just not make any money for them it loses money so what is a bookstore good for well or a book signing uh book signing is to meet the people at the bookstore as the author and have them be like wow the publisher is actually sending this author on tour it must be an important author maybe i'll read the book to get some extra books in that bookstore the publisher the bookstore will usually order like 50 copies or whatever depending on the author and then put them out on nice shelves and you will usually sign a bunch of those books and leave them and they'll use their discretionary space to put up an end cap for you like author who came through here are their signed books so you might sell extra books like that you might get more velocity selling books in the first week of release is way more useful than selling them in the 12th week of release if you sell a bunch of books in the first week of release all the bookstores say wow this is a very big important book we better order more copies it also places you on the best seller list which a bunch of sales at once is better than sales spread out for that you appear on the best seller list and then there are special places in the bookstore which aren't co-op space which are the best seller list that you get on basically as free co-op which markets and sells your book more if you do really well you end up on the bestseller list in the airports which can be huge exposure for selling your book these um things can are all kind of intangible things plus you start building an audience they start seeing coming out to see you as an event um and then it's a way to kind of meet the fan base and things like that all of these things are intangibles that are hard to quantify books signings should not be done to make money uh at least upfront money they should be kind of long-term sort of things early in my career i'll just give you guys a tip uh we ran all these numbers and the publisher was just not gonna send me on tour guy who got ten thousand dollars on his advance that they're expecting you know to sell like five thousand copies of or whatever the the books signing there was no way i was gonna get on the list there's no way i was going to make the money back they just were not going to send me on tour i went to them and said what if i went on tour with another author that you were thinking of sending on tour and the two of us shared a car and drove instead of flights which saves you know a bunch of money what if we just drove around the west coast where we where we live kind of the west coast um what if we shared a hotel room i was going with dave who's a buddy of mine and you know we kind of ate cheap um we we dave and i went and pitched and said you give us a thousand bucks each this was in 2005 so a thousand bucks went a little further um and we will do a 10 city book tour and it will bring it in under that thousand dollars each uh they're like you can't do that we're like yes we can and they're like all right here's a thousand bucks right whatever that's you know that it takes two thousand to put an author on tour for a day we'll give you each a thousand bucks for for ten days and we made it work um and we did uh three tours like that um before my book started exploding and the publisher started saying no you can't do that anymore uh we need to send you on a big real book tour um but that was very effective for me your mileage may vary in convincing a publisher to let you do something like that all right adam what do we got ten minutes just okay uh turn that over and let me hit a few of these questions how do you know if you're a niche genre so this is hard because knit genres tend to be genres that are mashing two or three genres together a lot of times what happens is you have a venn diagram of genres and it's hard to tell when you're going to get for instance let's say you have mysteries and romances right well sometimes when some when a book comes out it grabs both of these audiences in fact um you know sf science fiction fantasy uh charlane harris um who did the true blood books somehow grabbed some of each of these audiences and it worked really well and i think they shelved the true blood books in sci-fi fantasy um which makes some sense um but you know they were mystery moment science fiction uh fantasy they were basically vampire romance mysteries sometimes you grab that whole audience sometimes you only grab this audience and it's hard to tell i have a friend in the industry who published what looked like a book that was going to grab great big audiences it was basically military uh lawyers for a space fleet basically starfleet's military lawyers right where they've got this big military science fiction thing where you know there's like wars going on and they're going to do the trials of the people who you know violated whatever and they're going to be very action action adventurey but also with the lawyers it's like law and order meet star trek right and those books flopped hardcore despite being great books um and they only hit the venn diagram people who people pick them up they're like i like science fiction but i don't like lawyers so they put them down other people pick them up and like i like lawyer fiction but the science fiction stuff we don't know right like if if publishers knew how to market a book perfectly to the broadest possible audience they would do it every time they don't know nobody knows what's going to hit and what isn't if those books had been published online there might have been a thousand or two thousand people who are like wow i was in the military police i love science fiction this is just perfect for me this is like the best thing ever and you get that audience who just becomes a really dedicated um fan base that is what i would call a niche genre right kind of this melding of two genres that that doesn't grab the whole venge diagram but god's narrow group who are very dedicated to it indie publishing would be great for that fortunately that story has a happy ending because uh he re branded himself um and published a lot lost fleet books under the name jack campbell his name is john henry he's a great author um i really like lost fleet books but he took out basically the lawyer part and just did great military science fiction books and the books took off and sold really well um and so uh that has a happy story the publisher was really believed in them they all knew the books were good they just didn't hit the audience so he got another chance at it and ended up working for him um so do short stories sell well when any published no short stories do not sell well indie published historic short stories do well free there are places where free short stories do very well i have a student in the class this year who's done very well on no sleep the reddit short story horror subreddit um and gotten lots of views there but generally that price point is very hard for a short story novellas do sell a novella is uh 17 000 words and above as long as you can get that magic number of realistically charging 299 for it on amazon then suddenly it becomes viable anything under that 299 is just not viable monetarily that said short stories can be very popular they just don't work right now paid wise your mileage may vary ask some other people about what they've done with short stories i see collections now and then selling most of the short stories i see people put up for free just for advertising or they try to sell the magazines for prestige are there indie small presses publishers that specialize in novellas yes tor.com and several others tor.com generally prefers diverse books um that's one of the ways they have made their name right now and so they have a very narrow application submission guideline window and they tend to be looking for diverse fiction um and so uh do be aware of that but in the publishing with novella's work and there are some other places like tour.com for instance emperor's soul which was published with tachyon went with a small press for the print that was big enough to get the book in bookstores um but which was um which was uh small enough that they were willing to take print only rights and leave me with the ebook rights to sell myself um how would one go from indie publishing to traditional on their advantages to doing this yes i guess we'll end here what i got like five minutes left adam three minutes we'll end here if i were me trying to break in right now i would try going hybrid meaning i would write some books and i would then decide are these best traditional or these best indie if they're best traditional i would start submitting to the traditional publishers and if their best indie i would just start with indie at the same time i would be looking for something targeted at indie publishing that would work really well i would be like you know what i can write if you guys are fans of my books the wax and wayne books the fast-paced mysteries uh detective thrillers is really what they are that are shorter are a better match for indie publishing maybe if i were not well known and not broken out i would be like i'm going to write six of these across the next few years just in between other books save them up and then i'm going to launch the mindy published after books then go through the traditional publishing route and if they all got rejected i would hold them back for when i did an any publishing push so i could slot those books in at the end the big epic fantasies to be like if you liked my fast-paced you know ones maybe you will like the longer book that has more lore that is using the same world and so i might try to break out that way i think considering both as viable methods of breaking in is just the wisest way to go right now talking to a lot of authors both traditionally and indie publish finding out what's working for them is a great way to go don't close any doors do your research this is just an overview i couldn't get into a lot of the the depths of it i will next week if we have time during the questions try to outline the big five publishers and who they are to kind of give you a head start on uh submitting to them but for now do your research take this and hopefully you can expand it into something that will help you get published thank you guys we will see you next week for the last of our classes"}}
