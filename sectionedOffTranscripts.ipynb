      "stuff like that. It was at, by the way, Mama Chus. You guys like Mama Chus? Thumbs up. After the dinner, I turned to Emily and said,\n",
      "\"Wasn't that the best dinner ever?\" She was like, \"You didn't look at me one time\n",

      "find happens, that because the writers kind of get into their worlds, and they're doing\n",

      "about it, but you've got a blank page and you make something out of that. And it's like, what's in your brain, and someone\n",

      "you're taking nothing and making something from it. I love it. But you can get so invested in that that the\n",
      "people in your lives feel really left out. So I'm going to give you this warning at the\n",
      "beginning of the class. I'm going to, as a writer, push you to write\n",
      "a lot. But I'm going to suggest that you also learn\n",
      "to balance your life. Because it's very easy to burn out as a writer. It's very easy to because so consumed by this\n",
      "that it destroys aspects of your life. The thing that I've done, this is, again,\n",
      "just one of these tools to try, is that I started realizing that when I was with my\n",
      "family, I needed to be with my family. This was a hard transition for me, because\n",
      "I got married in my 30s. I had spent a lot of time learning to be a\n",
      "writer, and one of the things you learn to do as a writer, particularly one who has to\n",
      "work full time and go to school full time, is that you start to look for those moments\n",
      "when no one is asking you to do anything, and you use those to work on your stories. You carry around a notebook. You carry around your phone. Writers don't get bored, which is great. People are like, \"Oh, you were left alone,\n",
      "by yourself, waiting for me to show up for a half hour. I'm so sorry.\" And you're like, \"It was the only half hour\n",
      "that no one bugged me all day. I got so much work done, even though it was\n",
      "all up here.\" I started to use driving time. It's great for this. Something about moving while you're going\n",
      "and thinking, is just really handy for coming up with ideas. This is why, by the way, Kevin J. Anderson,\n",
      "aside, he goes on hikes and dictates all his books on hikes. He uses completely dictation software so he\n",
      "can be moving when he's writing. I know other people who've tried it and it\n",
      "actually works for them. It's never worked for me, because I don't\n",
      "think with spoken word the same way I do on the page. But I might be able to train myself if I really\n",
      "wanted to. But anyway, I was using all these moments. And so when I was driving somewhere, my wife\n",
      "would say, \"I know when you're thinking about a story, because if I say something you jolt,\n",
      "and you look at me like, 'What have you just done? I was in Roshar and it was cool.'\" Now I'm in a minivan. Where is my Spren? I started to realize; this could take over\n",
      "everything. And if instead I started putting boundaries\n",
      "in place to contain the imagination, and then be with my family when I was supposed to be\n",
      "with my family, my life would be better. So at 5:30, I am not allowed to work on books\n",
      "from 5:30 until 9:00. Doesn't matter if I have free time. Doesn't matter if the family is away or something\n",
      "like that. I have this barrier in place, and it has been\n",
      "so good for my life. Because it's also good to kind of step out\n",
      "into the real world. People accuse us of living in fantasy worlds. They don't understand. We're not living in fantasy worlds. We don't lose track of the real world. It's not like we are all these people who\n",
      "are schizophrenic and can't tell the difference between hallucinations and reality. That is no what it is. People always say that, and it always bugs\n",
      "me, because that's not what it is. I am constructing something. I'm building something. It's really engaging. It's really fulfilling. But it's not like I'm forgetting the world\n",
      "I live in, and things like that. Even if, when you interrupt me, I look like\n",
      "I'm really annoyed, because I kind of am really annoyed, because I was making a really cool\n",
      "connection between two different parts of my story. That barrier lets me step out, live my life\n",
      "as it should be lived, interacting with other people, and it makes me that much more refreshed\n",
      "when I go back to writing. This is why I do two sessions, by the way. Partially because I don't want to get up in\n",
      "the morning, because I'm a writer. I didn't do this job to get up at 8:00 AM. So I get up at noon. People are always asking me about it and they're\n",
      "like, \"Oh, you learned that while you were working the graveyard shift.\" I'm like, \"That's right. I did all those years at the graveyard shift\n",
      "and it has changed me, and now I have to suffer and live with this whole off schedule.\" No, no. I was like this before the graveyard shift. I've always wanted, I like being up at night. People leave me alone. So doing two sessions, for me, from about\n",
      "1:00 until 5:00, and then about 10:00 until 2:00 is great for my writing, because I have\n",
      "that time in between that just refreshes and relaxes me. I get to go do something else. And then when I sit back down to write, I'm\n",
      "excited to do it again for another four-hour session. I recommend finding, and at least understanding,\n",
      "what this can do to the relationships in your life, and taking some steps, they don't have\n",
      "to be the steps I took, to make sure that it doesn't consume you to the point that it\n",
      "ruins your ability to have good relationships. On the flip side, here are some tips you can\n",
      "give to a spouse or roommates, that you can talk about with them, to help them understand. Because one thing that people don't generally\n",
      "understand about most writers, again, writers are different, so everyone's different, most\n",
      "writers, takes us a little time to get into it. I don't know if this is the case for you. But you sit down with your laptop, and if\n",
      "you were to time yourself, for me that first hour, that's not a 500-word-an-hour hour. That's like a 200 words. And then that third hour is like 1,000 words\n",
      "in an hour. And then, like the fourth hour I'm starting\n",
      "to run out of steam, and it's like an average one, and the one in between is like an average\n",
      "one. So if I get interrupted for 15 minutes, after\n",
      "I've spent 45 minutes, like, really getting it going, what it does is it can reset me\n",
      "back to the first hour, the 200-word thing. What my wife didn't understand, and I didn't\n",
      "even understand at the time, is that a 5 to 15-minute interruption can mean more like\n",
      "a 45-minute delay in me getting to that zone where the writing's really working for me. Learning that, if this is the case for you,\n",
      "and being able to explain this block of time, whatever it is, is so precious, because it's\n",
      "only at the middle where it will really start coming and working for me. If you can get your friends and family to\n",
      "be the guardians of that time, so that they have a part in it, so you're like, \"These\n",
      "two hours, make sure no one interrupts me, and then I will be with you after I have done\n",
      "those two hours, because I will be so much more relaxed that I've gotten my writing done.\" My wife has learned this. She's like, \"Wow, if he gets his writing done,\n",
      "everything is great. But if he doesn't get his writing done multiple\n",
      "days in a row, he starts to get really anxious.\" And she will tell people, \"Brandon hasn't\n",
      "been able to write in a couple of days. Give him some space.\" This is why tours can be miserable in part. But giving her that sort of connection to\n",
      "the writing, letting her in to the brainstorming, when I talk about, \"Oh, I made this cool connection. Isn't this cool?\" has been really helpful\n",
      "for our relationship, and for my career in multiple ways. She's really good at guarding my time. She makes sure that I don't get interrupted. In exchange, when, not only-- Best-selling\n",
      "books are really good for marriages, because you don't have to worry when the money is\n",
      "coming in. If books aren't selling, it's bad for marriages,\n",
      "because it can be all the stress. So there is that. But there's also the idea that we're together\n",
      "on this, and we have a shared goal and a shared focus. Let me ask, before I do some stuff on the\n",
      "board, just about discovery writing. It's not actually stuff on the board. You'll understand in a minute. Any questions about what I've talked about\n",
      "here, about writing life, about becoming professional, and how you're treating this? Q: How do you overcome the sense of despair\n",
      "that you're not going to be able to make it? How do I overcome the sense of despair that\n",
      "you're not going to be able to make it? This comes from a couple of places for me,\n",
      "or did back in the days. Because I spent a lot of time not making it\n",
      "until I did. One was, Pandora's box, I still had hope. It could always happen. There are a lot of writers who toiled in obscurity\n",
      "for a long time, and then eventually sell. Don't let anyone tell you that if you haven't\n",
      "made it in 10 years that you just will never make it. Go ask George R. Martin what people said to\n",
      "him when he was a mid-lister for 30 years and barely was able to get people to read\n",
      "his books, for a long time, writing great books, and then suddenly he became the best-selling\n",
      "fantasy author in the world. Yeah, there is that hope. You can always still make it. Another is, for me, learning to focus on,\n",
      "am I satisfied with the writing? Am I proud of what I've done? And making sure that I am. Because it's a real achievement to finish\n",
      "things. I meet a lot of people who want to be writers. This class excluded, you want to bet what\n",
      "percentage of them actually finish a novel? Not very many. If you finish a novel, you are in a more select\n",
      "crowd than the select crowd between people who have finished a novel and gotten published. The cutoff percentage, the fall-off percentage\n",
      "of people who never finish a novel is much larger than the fall-off between those who\n",
      "finish a novel and get published. If you finish a novel, you are already in\n",
      "a more select crowd, the most select crowd you could probably be in as a writer, if you're\n",
      "looking at pure divisions of numbers, pure drop-offs between achieving certain goals. Be proud of the fact that you're finishing\n",
      "things. If you're not, we're going to work in this\n",
      "class on learning how to. Okay? Because that you have power over. Focus on what you have power over. You have power over whether you finish your\n",
      "stories. You have power over whether you're consistent. You have power over whether you are excited\n",
      "and interested in the stories you're creating. You do not have as much power over whether\n",
      "you're going to make it or not. That helped me a great deal. Another thing is to be exploring other options. Self-publishing is a real thing. It's possible that you are totally of professional\n",
      "quality in your writing and you just haven't found an editor who's willing to give the\n",

      "to juggle that with all the other things in your life, and it's training for that. That class, I mean, I require 30,000 words,\n",
      "is what I think we came up with. 35,000. 35,000 words in a semester. None of your other writing classes will ever\n",

      "and they're like, \"You're going to have to submit twice, and both submissions have to\n",
      "be 2,000 words.\" Half the class was like, \"Oh, no! How will I have that ready?\" I'm like, \"Seriously? That's an afternoon.\" So 35K. I'm going to require them to be in a writing\n",

      "in a writing group. But I will explain how you do writing groups,\n",
      "and I will give you the opportunity to split into writing groups to get practice. Now, here's the thing. Writing groups are also a tool that work for\n",
      "some people and not other ones. Part of the reason I force the class to do\n",
      "it, the 15-person class, is I want them to give it a good, pun intended, college try\n",
      "at having a writing group. Because if a writing group works, it is one\n",
      "of the most useful tools for you in your writing career. I am still in a writing group with the people\n",
      "I formed a writing group from in this class 20 years ago. Okay? Dan's not in it anymore because he moved to\n",
      "North Salt Lake and he doesn't want to drive. But the other people are still in the group\n",
      "with me, and they are the most useful group of people for bouncing ideas against, and\n",
      "things like that, that I have ever had. When Dan was in the group, he got me published. Peter's in the group. Peter went off and became a professional editor,\n",
      "and then I finally hired him away when I needed an editorial director at my company. He is just invaluable. So meeting these people in this class was,\n",
      "they were all in the class with me, and they're all still together, was super, super relevant. But let me give you the dark side of writing\n",
      "groups. Okay? Dark side of writing groups. One really dark side of writing groups is,\n",
      "particularly newer writers, don't know how to workshop. And one of the things they'll try to do is\n",
      "they'll try to make your story into the story they would write, instead of a better version\n",
      "of the story you want to write. And that is the single worst thing that can\n",
      "happen in feedback, is someone who is not appreciating the story you want to make, and\n",
      "they want to turn it into something else. New workshoppers are really bad at doing this. In other words, they're really good at doing\n",
      "a bad thing, which is trying-- And they're doing it from the goodness of their heart. They want you to be a better writer. They want to help you. The only way they know is to tell you how\n",
      "they would do it, which can be completely wrong for your story. This is extra dangerous if you are by nature\n",
      "more of a discovery writing. If you don't think about your story ahead\n",
      "of time, if you're not working from an outline, someone can come to you and say, \"Man, it'd\n",
      "be so much better if you did this.\" And you're like, \"My story needs to have that. It was a romance, but now it needs a mystery.\" And the next week someone says, \"Oh, you know,\n",
      "if I were doing this, I'd make sure there were vampires.\" You're like, \" Romances have vampires these\n",
      "days. I'd better write vampires into it. I mean, it was completely not a vampire story. It was a Regency, but now it's got vampires.\" And someone else is like, \"Oh, I don't really\n",

      "a deadline for submitting is really helpful. And it's okay to have to have a deadline in\n",
      "order to submit. We all have different psychology. Some of us need a deadline, and so you can\n",

      " Let's get started actually talking about sci-fi/fantasy. I'm going to start us off this year with plot. I do it randomly. Sometimes I start with character. Sometimes I start with setting. People often ask me, \"Where does a book begin\n",
      "for you?\" It's really different for every book, and\n",
      "sometimes, in many ways, it's kind of a chicken or an egg sort of thing. I often say that stories are made up of these\n",
      "three things. Plot, character, and setting. But they're glued together by conflict, and\n",
      "that glue of conflict is the thing that oftentimes, I'll have a plot idea, or a character idea,\n",

      "kind of a plot idea, but the idea that it turned into, a world where the prophesied\n",

      "the leverage team or whatever, a different magical power. So they could each be magical. You could do this whole thing. I was thinking of that separately. And that was another plot idea. The idea for the mist came as I was driving\n",

      "enough to have the promises, and not predictable enough to be predictable? Right. Great question. Wow. Okay, so the question was, how do we be predictable\n",
      "enough that we are giving promises, but not so predictable that we're boring, that we're\n",
      "predictable. There are a couple of answers to this. One of them is, generally, you can be, with\n",
      "your plot, a little more predictable than you think, as long as you are giving interesting\n",
      "setting and characters we care about. A lot of people talk about how many stories\n",
      "there actually are. There's only five stories, or whatever. You can find those online. The truth is, almost every plot that has been\n",
      "done, obviously ever plot that you conceive has been done. Most of the ways to buck the trend in those\n",

      "there's always Gandalf, or there's Allanon, or there's Belgarath, or there's always the\n",

      "of this. What do I mean by progress? We're going to go over here for progress. I started to figure this out early in my career\n",
      "when I was reading a book by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Forgive me, those of you who have heard this\n",
      "story before. The book is Inferno by Niven and Pournelle. Not their most famous. A lot of people have heard of them because\n",
      "of The Mote in God's Eye. Or Larry Niven wrote Ringworld, which was\n",
      "the inspiration for Halo. These are two fantastic science fiction authors. Inferno is about a science fiction author\n",
      "who goes to a party, gets drunk, falls out a window and dies, and wakes up in The Inferno,\n",
      "Dante's Inferno. Inferno is a classic style science fiction\n",

      "science fiction books felt very episodic. This is because the authors were either serializing\n",
      "them in magazines or were accustomed to doing so. Inferno reads like, we have this adventure\n",
      "with famous dead person. By the end of the adventure, the mini adventure,\n",
      "you figure out, \"That's probably Billy the Kid, isn't it?\" Then Billy the Kid is left at one part of\n",
      "the Inferno, and the main character continues on to the next part of the Inferno and has\n",
      "another wacky adventure with some perhaps famous person, with a lot of imagination showing\n",
      "off a fantasy writer's take on what it would be like to travel through hell. I was reading this book and I was compelled\n",
      "page by page, and normally I'm not in these episodic stories. I can still enjoy them. But usually I finish a story and I'm like,\n",
      "eh, I'm done. But each time I had to turn the page and keep\n",
      "moving. I asked myself, why do I read like I'm reading\n",
      "a thriller, thrillers are a genre that specializes in always making you turn the next page, when\n",
      "I'm reading this goofy adventure in hell that's very episodic. I realized one thing had made the difference. There was a map at the front of the book. Now, we laugh at this because I may have,\n",
      "maybe, a thing for maps. It's possible that you may have noticed that\n",
      "there are a lot of maps in some of my books. So you're like, \"Of course you noticed the\n",
      "map, Brandon.\" But this was not an epic fantasy story. But it had Dante's Inferno as a circle, where\n",
      "he started out here at the end and was moving toward the center. And the question of, what's at the center\n",
      "of hell and can he get out, was so compelling that I had to read each next adventure, because\n",
      "I could watch as he moved steadily inward. This is a really powerful sensation in readers,\n",
      "and it is part of what draws people to books and why they read. Every book has this by virtue of the pages\n",
      "in the book that the reader is watching count toward an endpoint as they go. Even if they aren't watching the actual numbers,\n",
      "watching themselves get through the book. There is a natural time bomb to reading a\n",
      "book. That's progress, that you, as the reader,\n",
      "being able to sense that you are progressing through a story, is fundamental and vital\n",
      "to making stories page turners. When you say page turner, most people's mind\n",
      "will go to something like a thriller, where something is always exploding, someone is\n",
      "always chasing you, and things like that. But you can write a page turner about anything. Does not have to have a single fight in it. No one has to be running anywhere. The page turner mentality is about you indicating\n",
      "to your reader that progress is happening and giving them a sense that it is building\n",
      "toward something that they want to see. This is a sense of progress. It is an illusion of progress. Because you have absolute control over this. If you wanted to, you could pass a thousand\n",
      "years in one sentence. \"And a thousand years passed.\" I would guess that most of you in this room,\n",
      "if I gave you the challenge, saying you have to write 20 pages on the time between the\n",
      "second hand moving from one second to the next, you could do it. It'd be boring, probably, but you could do\n",
      "it, just describing everything in the room and making everything slow down, and sticking\n",
      "with this moment, adding three flashbacks. You could, if you needed to, fill the whole\n",
      "book and make it take one second. You have absolute control over this. One of the big complaints that people who\n",
      "don't read a lot of fantasy or sci-fi make about it, is the complaint of, oh, they can\n",
      "just make anything happen, so there is no tension. This is, in one way, true, but it's a much\n",
      "larger problem in scope than they think, because you can do that in any genre. If you are writing a romance, you can say,\n",
      "\"And he got over himself and they got together.\" Takes one sentence. \"And then he got over himself. And they found a whole bunch of money that\n",
      "her uncle left them that they didn't know. Suddenly they could pay off the house\" and\n",
      "the evil whatever person who was loan sharking them and stuff, and the fact that they no\n",

      "after. You can do this in any story. We'll talk about how to not do this when we\n",
      "talk about Sanderson's First Law. But progress is absolutely, 100%, in your\n",
      "control, and because of that, you want to create an illusion for the reader that a steady\n",
      "progress toward an inevitable and exciting goal is happening in your story. You usually want to do this by identifying\n",
      "what your plot is going to be. What your actual story arc, not necessarily\n",
      "just your umbrella. Oftentimes, like I said, your story arc and\n",
      "your umbrella plot are the same. But you want to know, you want to ask yourself,\n",

      "you usually, at least I do, you make this happen by identifying what type of plot you\n",

      "got all the main ones, looking at that. Someone asked, when I was scanning the questions,\n",
      "which we'll start digging into next week, they said, \"Do you use only one sort of progress\n",
      "and one sort of payoff for a book, or do you use more?\" Which is an excellent question.\n",
      "There's your answer. Mistborn has four major ones that I was juggling. This is appropriate\n",
      "for an epic fantasy novel. The thing is, one does kind of have to be\n",
      "more important than the others, and as I worked on this book, I really kind of moved the heist\n",
      "kind of almost being secondary, and it was the master-apprentice plot that became the\n",
      "actual main, like if you're reading the book, most of the sense of progress you're getting\n",
      "is Vin becoming Mistborn, and that is the core. Most of the time you're spending with\n",
      "her is her going to the balls, fighting the people, learning the magics, all of these\n",
      "things. So it's actually really a master-apprentice story that has a B plot or a sub mode that\n",
      "is a heist, that also has these kind of minor other secondary plots.\n",

      "to use one of these plot structures or even these plot archetypes. But man, it can be\n",

      "that I told you in the first week. Instead of just following a recipe, I want you to\n",
      "start looking at recipes and things people have created and try to pull out what works.\n",
      "What I did is I went to a bunch of my favorite heist stories. I'm going to use films as examples\n",
      "because they are a little easier to break down the structure, because they tend to be\n",
      "more focused than a novel does by the nature of their medium. I'm going to use, I watched\n",
      "a bunch of heists, I read a bunch of heists, I mentioned a bunch of those in a previous\n",
      "week, and I settled on there being two main archetypes for a heist. I realized there was\n",
      "what I'm going to call the Oceans 11, and what I'm going to call The Italian Job. Both\n",
      "of these have had very prominent remakes around the time when I was working on these books.\n",
      "What happened with these, I looked at them and I'm like, what makes them interesting?\n",
      "Why do they work? Well, the Oceans 11 type plot goes like this. You gather a team. You\n",
      "usually have one newbie to explain things to. So you gather a team, you grab your newbie.\n",
      "You then have an explain the problem. In Oceans 11, the remake, they have this thing where,\n",
      "it's Brad Pitt that's there, they're saying, \"We have to do this,\" and he's like, \"Which\n",
      "we can't ever do.\" It might be George Clooney saying it. But it's basically they present\n",
      "the problem with the cool cinematic methodology to them. It's like here is the casino we're\n",
      "going to rob. They have this thing that we'll have to beat, which we can't beat because\n",
      "it's impossible. And they have this thing we have to beat, which we can't beat because\n",
      "it's impossible. And we have this thing. And they lay out basically here's the big problem\n",
      "of what we're going to do. Then they start talking about breaking it to little pieces.\n",
      "And you follow the newbie, usually, along going to get all the little parts that are\n",
      "going to come together for your big solution. But one of the key attributes of this heist\n",
      "was, at the end there's a piece missing that the newbie often is like, \"But what about\n",
      "this?\" And they're like, \"Oh, we'll figure that out. You don't have to worry about that.\"\n",
      "There's a big piece missing. You get to follow along in these little pieces as you see how\n",
      "they're going to solve each of the problems that they had in the explain the problem plot.\n",
      "But you've still got this lingering what's going to happen with the piece that's missing?\n",
      "Everything's going to go wrong. It creates this sense of doom and dread and inevitability.\n",
      "Until you get to the end and the twist is they all knew how they were going to solve\n",
      "that problem anyway. They just didn't tell the newbie so they could surprise us. At the\n",
      "ending you think everything went wrong, but then they take off their masks, and lo and\n",
      "behold they were the S.W.A.T. team all along, or something like that, and boom, we actually\n",
      "all went according to plan. You just didn't know it.\n",
      "This is different from The Italian Job plot, which has kind of some similar attributes,\n",
      "the gather a team, explain problem. But this style of heist did something really interesting\n",
      "that I found. They introduced problem A, problem B, problems A, B, C, and D. They said, \"We\n",
      "are going to solve them with solutions 1, 2, 3, and 4. You follow the plot kind of the\n",
      "same way. Except at the end, they get to the ending and they find out that instead of problems\n",
      "A, B, C, and D, they have problems E, F, G, and H. You've probably seen heists like this.\n",
      "They do all the planning. They do all their preparation. They're ready to go, and then\n",
      "they move the target. It goes to another country, or something like that. Suddenly all this\n",
      "preparation is out the window. We talked about this a little bit last week\n",
      "in the pull the rug out from underneath-- No, it wasn't to you guys. It was to someone\n",
      "else. Never mind. I told someone, they asked me what do I do if I want to pull the rug\n",
      "out from underneath people. This is a great way to do that, because the way that they\n",
      "solve this, do you guys know? Have you guys seen this movie? What do they do? They don't.\n",
      "Exactly. They take solution one and they say, \"Wow. If we jury-rig this thing, we can solve\n",
      "problem F with that. And number 4, the person that we've recruited specifically to crack\n",
      "the safe can actually break into this car that we can use. And suddenly we'll use 2\n",
      "for E and 3 for H.\" What happens is you get a jumbling up of all the preparations solving\n",
      "the problems in different and unexpected ways. Why this works so well is, oftentimes if you\n",
      "want to have a cool twist in your story and you pull the rug out from underneath people,\n",
      "it's a little bit like I said last week, promising someone a car and giving them something else\n",
      "completely different that they're not expecting. In addition, in your storytelling, your reader\n",
      "will invest time in the middle, in your progress. They'll spend most of the time in the book\n",
      "focusing on the things the characters are doing to progress the story. So if you built\n",
      "a heist where you made 1, 2, 3, and 4 completely irrelevant now, that is 80% of the reader's\n",
      "experience in the story getting thrown out the window, and they will feel annoyed at\n",
      "you. They will be frustrated because you promised them something. You were also probably promising\n",

      "you have also upended them. How do you solve this? You make sure that\n",
      "the time they spent on 1, 2, 3, and 4 is still very relevant by applying it on the fly to\n",
      "solve new problems, which suddenly becomes very satisfying because you both get a twist,\n",

      "looking at. Yeah?\n",

      "We want to know what happened. We want to know how they did it. Unless the reversal\n",
      "is they show you how they did it, and then you're going to see-- like was that Columbo,\n",
      "where they reversed, they inverted the trope? Yeah.\n",
      "Student: Sometimes it's a puzzle for you, the challenge of, can I figure this out before\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes does? Yep. That, I think, is a major draw of mysteries.\n",
      "Can I figure it out? Let me highlight that one for a minute, because mysteries, if you\n",
      "cheat, and the reader couldn't have figured it out, a lot of times it will feel very unsatisfying\n",
      "for this reason. People are not understanding, writers are not understanding that part of\n",
      "the promise of a mystery is you will be able to figure this out. If you are laying the\n",
      "clues, it's not going to be so out there. If you've read or watched a mystery that was\n",
      "really unsatisfying to you at the ending, it might have been because they promised,\n",
      "ooo, with these clues of information you could solve this crime, and then there was no way\n",
      "for you to come anywhere close. You feel cheated at the end.\n",
      "Student: I like the possibility of having very witty characters with really great dialogue\n",
      "to bounce off each other as the investigator tries to decipher [___].\n",
      "Right. That tends to be a hallmark of the detective-driven murder mystery, is you're\n",
      "going to like the detective. It might be because they're witty. It might just be because they're\n",
      "folksy, and they're more Agatha Christy. You're just going to enjoy-- Not Agatha Christy,\n",
      "Angela Lansbury. They're going to be Angela Lansbury. You're just going to enjoy watching\n",

      "Go ahead. Yeah. Student: I think one of the things I like\n",
      "about mysteries is the misdirection. You can still figure it out.\n",
      "Right. You don't go from point A all the way to,\n",
      "okay, okay, I think this is where it's going. Instead it'll be like, I didn't see that,\n",
      "but now I can see where that's coming from. Right. A mystery implies that there is going\n",
      "to be some difficulty to this, and there are going to be new revelations. I identify a\n",
      "mystery as an information plot. A mystery is, characters don't have all the information,\n",
      "and the progress is watching the characters get that information as you try to put together\n",
      "what that information means. Spoiler, in Mistborn it is the true history of the Lord Ruler.\n",
      "I won't say what it is. But the true history of the Lord Ruler, the book lies to you at\n",
      "the beginning, and then indicates that the story is a lie that you've been told, gives\n",
      "you clues along the way, and then the mystery comes together at the end of understanding\n",
      "it. Now, what is really fun to do is, in Mistborn\n",
      "the missing piece is not something Kelsior knows 100%. It is the information plot. If\n",
      "we can put together the information plot, we can solve the missing piece of the heist\n",
      "that Kelsior is confident he can do but doesn't quite have all the pieces yet. I was able\n",
      "to slot that information plot into this big problem in the plan as presented.\n",
      "But relationships, why do we like--? By the way, usually a buddy cop movie and a Jane\n",
      "Austen novel follow about the same plot archetype. Just with some different trappings and subplots.\n",
      "A lot of classic romances and classic buddy cop movies are just relationship plots. Whether\n",
      "it's a bromance or a romance, it tends to follow the same plot beat. What's exciting\n",
      "for us about a romance? Why are we reading a romance? Why do writers put them in almost\n",
      "every story? Student: It gives poor guys like me hope.\n",
      "Wish fulfillment. Yes. Wish fulfillment. Do not discount the power of wish fulfillment,\n",
      "in all kinds of plots. What else? Student: It's very humanly relatable. We can't\n",
      "relate to superheroes to the degree that we can relate to someone who's in love.\n",
      "Right. Absolutely. I think you nailed it. It is one of these plots that you can put\n",
      "into the most fantastical and strange of stories to give it a really powerful human element.\n",
      "Student: I think it shares something with mysteries in that you know the mystery is\n",
      "going to be solved. You know the two people are going to get together, because you figure\n",
      "it out before it happens. Right. They are generally going to get together,\n",
      "but how? The how is really exciting and interesting to us. We have two romance writers right over\n",
      "here. Do you guys have anything to add? Student: I was going to say for old people\n",
      "it's nice to remember how it used to feel. Nice to remember how it used to feel. That\n",
      "is also pretty awesome. We're going to have these two ladies talk to us one of the weeks\n",
      "about indie publishing, because both of them have indie published a number of books. So\n",
      "look forward to that on how we're going to do that.\n",
      "I don't want to spend a ton of time on this. Sometimes we get up on the board and we start\n",

      "a guy named James Campbell was a researcher, an ethnographer, and a folklorist, and was\n",
      "researching different stories that different people told themselves. He wasn't the first\n",
      "to come up with this, but he kind of popularized the idea that a lot of different cultures\n",

      "He called this the monomyth, the story that-- He said, he's like all stories align to this.\n",
      "No they don't. But a lot of stories do, because it's got a very vague structure that has a\n",
      "lot of cool elements to it. The monomyth is you have a character at home who doesn't want\n",
      "to go on an adventure. They get called on an adventure. They refuse the call. And then\n",
      "they are Forced to go out and cross the threshold into the world. All right? What's that?\n",
      "Student: To the unknown. To the unknown. Yeah, to the unknown. Out\n",
      "to the unknown to the character. The classic example of this is Star Wars, because Luke\n",
      "is really like the monomyth. He likes it a little too much sometimes. But he really likes,\n",
      "he has actually some really good, there were PBS specials about the monomyth that I think\n",
      "George Lucas himself did. But, yes. Luke is at home. You see the call. He looks up in\n",
      "the sky. But then when the call-- you see he wants to go. But then when the call actually\n",
      "comes and everyone says, \"You must learn the ways of the Jedi,\" what does he do? He's like,\n",
      "\"No, I've got to go back home and deal with power converters and stuff.\" No, I can't,\n",
      "I can't, I can't. Then he goes home and what happens? There is no home anymore. Only Storm\n",
      "Troopers are so precise, or whatever. So he's forced to go out into the unknown world. Then\n",
      "they have the trials. This is the road of tribulation, or whatever it's called. Basically,\n",
      "problems are popping up, and the character is learning to overcome them.\n",
      "Usually there's a mentor. And then there's not a mentor. Whoop, whoop. No-o-o-o! Usually\n",
      "you get some buddies who will suspiciously not be around anymore by the time you get\n",
      "to the bottom of this, which is the descent in the underworld, which is where the character\n",
      "either metaphorically or literally dies and is sent to the underworld. Metaphorically,\n",
      "they're at their lowest point. Everything's going terribly. But then they come out of\n",
      "it. They have the-- what's it called? There's the moment of apotheosis and redemption. They\n",
      "call it something else. Campbell calls it something else. What's that? There's rebirth,\n",
      "definitely. Atonement, that's what it is. Basically, the character's going to change\n",
      "in some way, make some decision, learn some new skill, make atonement. They're going to\n",
      "get rewarded with the elixir. Then they're going to go home with it and take the elixir\n",
      "back. There's generally an apotheosis here, where it's like a meeting with divinity or\n",
      "with one's father figure, and kind of accepting and dealing with that, taking the elixir,\n",
      "and heading home changed, bringing the elixir back to the people at home, but having been\n",
      "changed so much that the hero is no longer the person who can stay home. Often there's\n",
      "an epilogue where they just wander off. Fallout, right? Was that Fallout One? That was Fallout\n",
      "One, wasn't it? Is this useful? Yes, it is. It's really useful\n",
      "for envisioning a character arc in an interesting way. It's really handy. I would recommend\n",
      "reading about the Hero’s Journey. Where can it go wrong? Well, there are a lot of\n",
      "things in the Hero’s Journey that don't match every story. For instance, Campbell\n",
      "identified that the hero in the ancient myths was almost always the result of a divine birth\n",
      "or a virgin birth. In the old Greek myths, Zeus was doing something, there was a really\n",
      "pretty swan or whatever, and there is often this child of divinity or child that was born\n",
      "out of mysterious circumstances. So what did he add into episode one? Where did Darth Vader\n",
      "come from? He was a virgin birth, born of the Force. Every single person in that movie\n",
      "theater when I was there was like, \"What? Like this is cool, but what?\" If I'm going\n",
      "to criticize one of the greatest and most successful storymakers of all time in George\n",
      "Lucas, which he really is, that is what I consider one of the dangers of being too slavish\n",
      "to a formula or a plot structure. This is where it gets different from an archetype.\n",
      "The plot archetypes are like, I want to achieve this emotion in my readers, and here are some\n",
      "steps to get that emotion. Structure is, all right, here's how I actually structure my\n",
      "story. And if these are too rigid, you will end up putting things into your story that\n",
      "just don't feel like they fit. They generally will not ruin your story. But once in a while,\n",
      "people can be too slavish, I feel, to following one of these plot structures.\n",
      "How would you use the Hero’s Journey? Well, looking at this and asking yourself as a chef,\n",
      "why do we enjoy this story? Well, there can be lots of answers, and we're down to 10 minutes,\n",
      "so I'm not going to go to questions on this one. But we can talk about the idea that all\n",
      "human beings kind of have to go through this. It's the story of being a teenager in a lot\n",
      "of ways, and arriving at adulthood, hopefully about the literal death and rebirth. But it\n",
      "is this thing where we are going to go through all of our lives, and we have to—\n",
      "I have a 12-year-old. I'm like, \"You're going to go to college, not too much further by\n",
      "adult times, six years or so.\" He's like, \"I can't do that. I cannot move\n",
      "out.\" I'm like, \"You don't have to. You're 12. 12-year-olds\n",
      "don't move out.” But to him, this is the most terrifying thing\n",
      "that he ever learned, is that he is going to be someday expected to leave the house\n",
      "and live on his own. That is really scary to a lot of people. We go through this.\n",
      "Why else is it cool? Well, it's really satisfying. Like this moment. It's full of satisfying\n",
      "moments, right? This moment is satisfying because you can usually see the hero wants\n",
      "to go on the adventure, and then they're Forced to. That moment is kind of cool. The moment\n",
      "where they go into the underworld, where they're at their darkest point, and they pull out\n",
      "of it anyway, is really satisfying. The apotheosis and atonement, where kind of coming to face\n",
      "one's destiny, one's parental figures, to make amends for the things that they've done,\n",
      "and then return home a better person, having brought something that helps everyone else,\n",
      "whether it's having destroyed a Death Star or not, coming home victorious is really satisfying.\n",
      "This explains a lot of really satisfying small steps you can take, and that makes progress\n",
      "really exciting. When the small steps of progress, on their own, give people cold chills, then\n",
      "you're doing the right thing. Then your book is coming together. The Hero's Journey is\n",
      "just all about those moments, those triumphant moments, or those moments that are really\n",
      "relatable, and it's why it makes such a good plot structure.\n",
      "Another one that you guys may have run across is Three Act format, which is kind of just\n",
      "a remix on the same ideas as most plot archetypes are. Three Act format imagines a story as\n",
      "three acts with two major division points, the first one being generally where the character\n",
      "becomes proactive. Now, you can find a lot on Three Act format. I'll just say, if I'm\n",
      "not writing the one you know, it's okay. There are lots of different ways. But one is the\n",
      "change from inactive to proactive. This is the moment where you go from Act I to Act\n",
      "II, where the character says, \"I will go do this.\" And everybody argues on where the different\n",
      "act breaks are, which is how you can tell this is a little more squishy than people\n",
      "pretend. Everyone, again, usually uses Star Wars as\n",
      "a perfect example of this, but they will disagree on whether Act I ends when Luke decides to\n",
      "go with Obi Wan because he has no other choice, or when they get off of Tatooine, or when\n",
      "they get on the Death Star and decide to go save the princess. All are legitimate arguments\n",
      "for the end of Act I. You usually have a transition between Act\n",
      "II and Act III where you're at the low point, where all the things you have tried thus far\n",
      "have just dug you deeper. And the way you do the middle is you have, generally there's\n",
      "a mid-point twist, where the stakes change in some dramatic way, usually an expansion\n",
      "of the stakes, or the villain's achieved something. Generally through here you have this rising\n",
      "action where you increase stakes, increase tension, and the character tries things, and\n",
      "oftentimes fails spectacularly. This is what we try a try-fail cycle, is how\n",
      "Dave liked to put it. The character has come up with a solution to their problem. They\n",
      "try it, they fail, and it gets worse. They try it again, they fail, and it gets worse.\n",
      "They try it again, they fail, and it gets worse. And now we're at our low point because\n",
      "we've tried everything. Oh, no, what are we going to do? Frodo has decided to keep the\n",
      "ring. Spoilers, right? Yeah. Seventy years old, is it now? Some spoilers. Sixty years\n",
      "old? But, yeah. We are at a moment of utter crisis, and then the ending happens, and very\n",
      "soon after, woo, end, and then denouement. This can be really handy, again, to structure\n",
      "your story if you know you need to have a moment where your character takes initiative.\n",
      "You need to have something right about the middle point of your story where the stakes\n",
      "change in a dramatic and different way, and that needs to lead into a low point where\n",
      "everything has been tried, but there is still one chance. If Luke trusts in the Force he\n",
      "can fire the torpedoes, even though the last ones missed, because he has the Force.\n",
      "You can bring in, when it works really well, your overlapping different plots. For instance,\n",
      "Star Wars has Han's mini plot of an arc of will Han be a good guy or not? Is he going\n",
      "to learn to want something more than money? Lo and behold, what happens is you overlap\n",
      "the lowest moment, Luke finally deciding to finally trust the Force, Obi Wan speaking,\n",
      "and Han returning all at once, and it becomes this really beautiful moment where all your\n",
      "different plots intersect. That's what I really love, is when you can take multiple plots\n",
      "like a character arc, where the character makes that last big decision or understands\n",
      "at last the thing that they have been missing about their life, overlapping with a big surprise,\n",
      "overlapping with the climax of the story, that's where a story can really get me, if\n",
      "they can do that. So, Brandon, what about discovery plotting.\n",
      "I don't have a ton to say on this, because I don't do it. I would recommend going to\n",
      "other people who do discovery write, reading what Stephen King talks about with discovery\n",
      "writing, reading what George R. R. Martin says about gardening.\n",
      "I will tell you one thing you can try, and we'll end here. Mary Robinette, which if she\n",

      "works pretty well, and it is called \"yes, but/no, and.\" Yes, but/no, and focuses on\n",
      "taking a character, throwing them into some sort of terrible situation at the very start,\n",

      "subverting expectations is not itself necessarily a virtue. This is because if you wanted a classic quest\n",

      "full of promises of a certain style, and I'm the person that wanted that, and then you\n",
      "took it away from me at the end.\" Now, if you're a person who loves subverted\n",
      "expectations, and you love the idea of taking classic tropes and twisting them and mangling\n",
      "them, what happens to you? What's your response to this book? “I don't get to the part that I would enjoy,\n",

      "this is an interesting object lesson, I think, for you to take, where not fulfilling on your\n",

      "gives the reader more than they expected, better than they expected, or if you spent\n",

      "fundamental thing you think about when building a magic system?\" I thought I could just really knock this one\n",
      "out of the park. They asked me to go first. I said, \"Well, obviously, a magic system needs\n",

      "me and said, \"No! If you put rules on your magic you ruin it.\" I was shocked that the next half hour of our\n",

      "plus one does not equal two. I was flabbergasted that I had to argue this. But through that discussion I actually started\n",
      "to realize my way of doing it was not the only way to do it, and in fact, a lot of the\n",
      "stories I liked didn't explain the rules of the magic to me, and maybe didn't even have\n",
      "rules that the author relied upon. I thought, well, how is this working then? So I started to build this second sort of\n",
      "philosophy about magic, which is that there is, the way I see it, a kind of continuum,\n",
      "a sliding scale that you can be on. On one side is a sense of wonder about the\n",

      "direction, you're able to solve problems in a satisfying way with your magic. What does this mean? Why am I saying this? Well, if you give your characters some tools,\n",

      "that I talked to you about a couple weeks ago, where you can take a certain archetype\n",
      "where you give someone a group of tools, they work on it, and then they rearrange them to\n",

      "is that sense of wonder twisted on its head to a sense of horror. A lot of times, horror is twisting a positive\n",

      "some friends in Hollywood who are very good at screenplays, who are giving me advice,\n",
      "and I've done some brainstorming sessions with them. So I am approaching how to do this. One of the things I ran into is in the book,\n",
      "this isn't too much of a spoiler for the book, in the book, Kelsior takes Vin, Kelsior's\n",
      "the mentor figure, Vin is learning the magic, out into the mist to explain how the magic\n",
      "system works. In a book it actually works pretty well. It's like, instead of sitting down in the\n",
      "classroom, he takes her out and says, \"All right, let's try this and experiment with\n",
      "this.\" She's like, \"All right. We'll try this magic power. We'll try this magic power.\" That alone takes it away, takes it several\n",
      "steps. One thing you could do is include an encyclopedia\n",
      "entry on the magic you're doing. That's your worst choice. Choice number two is to have the characters\n",
      "sit and talk about the magic and get it explained. That's still a pretty bad choice, but at least\n",
      "it's moved to dialogue. Choice number three is, let's go out and experiment\n",
      "and having problems making it work, and the teacher instructing them. That works pretty well in the book. In the screenplay I don't have time for that,\n",
      "and it would work less well on screen. So what did I do is I combined that scene\n",
      "and the scene also early in the book where Kelsior sneaks into House Venture to steal\n",
      "a bead of atium. In the movie version, these were the same\n",
      "scene. Vin's followed him. She's like, \"You promised to train me.\" He's like, \"All right, baptism by fire. Come with me and we're going to try these\n",
      "different things while we're robbing these people.\" So by overlapping those scenes, suddenly there's\n",
      "way more tension to \"Now you've got to learn to do this, and if you don't, that guard is\n",
      "going to alert us, and we'll all be in trouble.\" And when she screws up he can help out and\n",
      "things, but now there's a tension to the scene. And the scene combines two scenes and it gets\n",
      "way more active and interesting because the reader's like, or I guess in this case really\n",
      "the viewer's like, \"Oh, now there's some real consequences on the line to this same sort\n",
      "of project.\" The same thing is happening, practice, same\n",
      "sort of practice, same thing is happening as happened in the book, but in a situation\n",
      "with increased tension. That is also a good way to make sure this\n",
      "happens. Now, you have to balance that. Because one of the things you risk when you're\n",
      "bring this into a tense scene is that the reader might get lost and confused while and\n",
      "action sequence is happening, which is generally a bad idea. Fortunately, on film I have all the ability\n",
      "to visualize a lot of this, so I don't have to explain it in the same way as I do in a\n",
      "book, which makes that scene work. One of the biggest challenges to writing science\n",
      "fiction and fantasy is how you get across your world building elements in a way that\n",
      "is not boring. To do this you need to construct your scenes\n",
      "deliberately, in a way that gives you a chance to not just show the magic working, but to\n",
      "show character and setting details while you are explaining the magic in some way. In fact, the point of the scene might be to\n",
      "explain the magic, but your emphasis in the scene should be making sure the character\n",
      "is interesting and you're showing as much or more about the character as you are about\n",
      "the magic, or at least you are providing excitement equivalent to that. Try to do multiple things at once, and make\n",
      "sure you are keeping your focus on the character. All right? Okay. Let's move on to Sanderson's Second Law. All right. Sanderson's Second Law comes about because\n",
      "I was sitting and thinking about powers that I put in my books. This one also kind of relates a little bit\n",

      "are new powers? What are new things I can put in my books\n",
      "that are going to be different? Someone came to me at a book signing once\n",

      "\"these are not the droids you're looking for because they can manipulate emotions,\" and\n",

      "I'm not.\" Well, that's a completely different story. You are probably going to worry you're not\n",
      "original too much, because the end of the day, the most original thing you can add to\n",
      "a story is your perspective, and that is unique to you. Now, the more you write, the more you will\n",
      "realize how to not be derivative. Because when you start off you will be derivative,\n",

      "because the people telling the small scale story have such limited special effects budgets\n",
      "that they can't make a big spectacle of Superman punching someone harder than that person can\n",
      "punch, and so they have to say, \"Well, what else can we do?\" And Superman stories generally fall into one\n",
      "of three categories. The first one is what I just said. Someone has shown up who can punch harder\n",
      "than Superman. Oh, no! That's where the movies tend to go a lot. What is the other Superman story? Somebody has kryptonite. Oh, no, I don't have my powers anymore. What is story number three? I am unable to use my powers effectively to\n",

      "H. Okay, story time. Early in my career, this has nothing to do\n",
      "with anything, early in my career, I was guest of honor at a con up in, like, North Salt\n",
      "Lake or something, and they're like, \"The local news station wants to have you on the\n",
      "news on the morning show.\" I'm like, \"Wow, this is really cool. I've never been on the news before. That's great.\" They're like, \"Yeah, but they're going to\n",
      "invite several other people, and you're all going to be on TV.\" I'm like brand new. I'm like, \"Be on TV!\" So I show up and who's going to be on? It's me and Ursa, the Superman II villain,\n",
      "the one that's a woman, and a group of Storm Troopers. And the notice thing was us just standing\n",
      "there, and they're like, \"Look at these weirdos at this science fiction convention. You should go meet them.\" It was actually a fine experience, but I'm\n",
      "like, \"Wow, my now claim to fame is being on TV with the villain from Superman II. Not that one, not that one, but that one,\n",
      "and some Storm Troopers.\" Somewhere, someone has that clip of me standing\n",
      "there awkwardly, being like, \"Oh, yeah, I guess we are the weird-- the zoo has come\n",
      "to town and we wear Storm Trooper armor.\" She was very nice, by the way. But that's neither here nor there. The stories that people look to tell about\n",
      "Superman I think are instructive to us because generally they are looking to tell stories\n",
      "about things that Superman's powers don't really influence. In fact, my favorite episode that I remember\n",
      "of Lois and Clark was, like, there was this robot who had kryptonite. They're like, \"We're powering it by kryptonite\n",
      "so if it punches Superman it'll take away all his powers.\" But the whole rest of that story, this robot's\n",
      "here, he's dealing with something with Lois, which is really interesting and engaging,\n",
      "because it's character relationship stuff, and his powers come into play almost not at\n",
      "all. They do this, they have this thing, and at\n",
      "the end of the episode they're like, \"Oh, yeah, you have to go fight this robot.\" He's like, \"Oh, right, I can fly, and I have\n",
      "laser vision.\" So he flies up and he lasers the thing and\n",
      "then he flies away, and it takes, like, 10 seconds. That is writers who understood that Superman\n",
      "punching harder than something is not as interesting as the fact that he has galactic-scale godlike\n",
      "powers but can't interact with the human world. He's still just a nerd who can't make relationships\n",
      "work. That's why that show worked. Now, what does this have to do with? Well, when you're developing your magic, naturally\n",
      "a lot of your stories are going to err toward conflict. So they are going to err toward one of these\n",
      "kind of three stories. Either the character is not skilled enough\n",
      "with their magic yet and needs to level up. Or, they need to find something that's not\n",
      "working in the magic and fix it so that they can then use their magic the correct way. Or, the magic is not working right now. \"What do I do?\" Or, the magic can't solve this problem. It can maybe help me with the surrounding\n",
      "things, but I need to then find a way to solve this problem using my other attributes, not\n",
      "just my magic. Those are going to be your three paradigms\n",
      "for telling stories about the magic. there are others. But those are kind of the three catchalls. All of those deal with this idea of your flaws\n",
      "and your limitations are a big part of why those stories are working. I view these three things as three different\n",

      "philosophies and religions, which allows us to not have to explain as much by using the\n",

      "writer, one of my greatest strengths was also one of my greatest flaws, which is often the\n",
      "way it is. In fact, if you can write your characters that way, it is usually a good\n",
      "idea. For me, this was my ability to write fast and my eagerness to work on new projects.\n",
      "What this did during my early days as a writer is it pulled me through a lot of books. I\n",
      "got through those bad words, those terrible words, that writers often have when they're\n",
      "newer. I got to experiment a lot with stories. I wrote 13 novels in 10 years. This was a\n",
      "good strength to me. It helped me build confidence. It helped me build momentum.\n",
      "It was also a drawback in that I did not ever learn revision. The biggest thing that held\n",
      "me back from getting published was the ability to take an okay or good story and turn it\n",
      "into a great story. That is a separate and important skill. Sometimes as a writer who--\n",
      "there are some of you in this class that are like me. You are overachievers in regards\n",
      "to word counts. One of the dangers of this is taking bad habits\n",
      "and perpetuating them so long that it's that much harder to break you out of those bad\n",
      "habits later on, particularly prose-wise, things like that. Writing with flabby prose,\n",
      "writing with using the same three metaphors over and over again, writing using cliched\n",
      "terms and things like this. If you just get into that habit and you write two million\n",
      "words that way, it's that much harder to break you out.\n",
      "For me, that was a drawback, and also revision. I kept thinking, I'd get feedback on a book\n",
      "from my readers, I'd send it around and I'd be like, \"Wow, there's so much wrong with\n",
      "this book. How about I just write a better one next time that doesn't have all these\n",
      "problems?\" Well, that was not the right way of looking at it, at least after I entered\n",
      "my journeyman stage as a writer. After I got my first couple of bad books--\n",
      "I say bad books. They're actually not terrible, and the books that you're writing aren't terrible.\n",
      "But there are certain things you generally can't learn about constructing a plot and\n",
      "how to make payoffs happen until you just get some fluency with writing endings. For\n",
      "most of us that means writing a number of stories till you start to get a feel for how\n",
      "the beats of a story work in the type of story you're writing. And then learning to take\n",
      "those books and make them better is just really, really handy.\n",
      "If we have time today, I'll launch into a little mini lecture on revision, to talk about\n",
      "how I do it, and how I know some other do it different strategies for that, like I did\n",
      "prose last time with Q&A, or descriptions. All right. \"How do you create a magic that\n",
      "doesn't seem like magic?\" This is actually a really interesting question,\n",
      "because I do think that in a lot of books you have a magic system, even when you don't\n",
      "have a magic system. Like, when I use the term magic, I'm also referring to most technology\n",
      "and most science fiction books, and I'm just also kind of talking about the fundamental\n",
      "rules of how things work. You might say that a lot of spy thrillers\n",
      "don't have a magic system. But to me, I kind of regard them as happening in \"spy world\"\n",
      "where there are certain foundational understandings, where it's like, the way that gadgets work,\n",
      "the way that everyone always betrays you. I've talked about this idea. Like, there's\n",
      "an aesthetic. That's part of, I think, the magic system for me.\n",
      "How do you make a magic system that doesn't feel like a magic system? One way is you make\n",
      "it technology. Science fiction, with a few exceptions of people who really knew their\n",
      "stuff, like Arthur C. Clarke, is generally not actually going to be real science. It's\n",
      "going to be fantastical science. So let's talk a little bit along these lines.\n",
      "I promised you guys, I think, I'd talk about this, internal versus external consistency.\n",
      "And external. I don't know if I spelled those right. I probably spelled them differently\n",
      "both times. Yeah, did I? See? See? Yeah. That's one of those ones that I have set in my computer\n",
      "to autocorrect when I do it wrong. That's sort of the same thing. I've never had to\n",
      "learn how to spell it right, because my computer just fixes it for me. Like, villain? That\n",
      "I and that A should not be in the order they actually are.\n",
      "Regardless, let's talk about internal versus external consistency. Or logic. I should just\n",
      "say logic, because I can spell that. Internal logic, internal consistency, is usually\n",
      "really important for most stories. Not for all stories. In fact, some humor stories make\n",
      "a big deal out of their internal logic just being haywire, and that's a feature rather\n",
      "than a bug. But for most of the time, when we talk about internal consistency, this is\n",
      "where the internal logic of your story fits and is consistent with itself. If this character\n",
      "puts on a magic ring and turns invisible, then you can extrapolate that this character\n",
      "will later on put on the ring and turn invisible again. This is being consistent with your\n",
      "own rules and the rules that you give. This is generally really important for even\n",
      "soft magics. Really important for hard magic, but even important for soft magic that you\n",
      "can rely on a few things. It's consistent. Even if your soft magic is we're not sure\n",
      "what Gandalf can do, well then, you generally stay consistent of, we don't know what Gandalf\n",
      "can do. Now you can move along that line. You can\n",
      "start moving from soft to hard magic. In fact, almost every fantasy story slowly moves along\n",
      "this line as you learn more and more what it can do. But you're just trying not to break\n",
      "your own rules. Now people mistake this with external logic,\n",
      "or external consistency, where when you try to explain why the things are happening in\n",
      "a way that makes sense to a person who understands physics and the laws of our universe.\n",
      "An example of external logic, logic is much better, external logic is when they say X-Men\n",
      "happened because they have the X gene. That is an attempt at external logic. They're saying,\n",
      "you know how mutation works. If you watch some of the X-Men movies they're like, \"Sometimes\n",
      "mutations happen, and evolution happens rapidly.\" And they're trying to give it some external\n",
      "logic to the story. Don't mistake those. Oftentimes I will mention\n",
      "in lectures that superhero magic systems tend to be very hard magic systems, particularly\n",
      "used modernly. People mistake that saying, \"Hard magic system? Superhero magic doesn't\n",
      "make any sense.\" Well, yes, but Wolverine has a healing factor. He always has a healing\n",
      "factor. This is what he does. It's consistent. It's hard magic. You understand what he can\n",
      "do. That doesn't mean it has to make sense. Internal logic, it doesn't matter that Superman\n",
      "gets power from the sun somehow. But that's an attempt at external logic.\n",
      "Try to make sure you understand, like, why is this important. Well, some genres really\n",
      "depend on your external logic working. This is hard science fiction, for an example. you\n",
      "don't have to be 100% realistic, but you have to give people an ability to make the leap\n",
      "of logic. And in fact, a little bit of external logic, applied even to a fantasy book, can\n",
      "help people suspend their disbelief quite a bit.\n",
      "This is why, in writing hard magic systems like I do, I usually add in a little bit of\n",
      "external logic. I usually say, all right, this is the characters discussing the laws\n",
      "of thermodynamics if you know physics, and then pointing out the hole, and this is how\n",
      "it works. Like, I give a little bit of that so the reader can suspend disbelief.\n",
      "So how can you make a magic that doesn't feel like a magic? A lot of that's going to depend\n",
      "on do you add a lot of external logic. Do you convince them that it's not a magic, that\n",
      "it's just the way things work? Or you can sometimes have a magic system that's built\n",
      "into just the way, the logic of the universe. We don't necessarily question that in spy\n",
      "thrillers people can wear masks that make them look like other people. Well, sometimes\n",
      "we do. But you know what I mean. You wouldn't call that a magic system really. But that\n",
      "totally is of the spy genre. If you have a spy thriller where no one had had a mask up\n",
      "until the midpoint and then they pull it off, a lot of times in movies, the audience is\n",

      "If a person who is a vampire drinks someone's blood and gets their energy back at the end\n",
      "of a book where they've never done that before, most readers are going to be like, oh, yeah,\n",
      "that's what vampires do. That's another way to kind of have a magic system that you are\n",
      "playing off of, but that doesn't feel like magic, is if it's playing into the genre conventions\n",
      "in such a way that the general reader with fluency in that genre is going to expect it\n",
      "and not get tripped up by it. \"How do we give enough exposition to make\n",
      "the reader understand the world, but maintain mystery and twists?\" That's a great question.\n",
      "Let me ask you, audience. How do you, in your own writing, or have you seen it in other\n",
      "people's writing or stories, have you read books with a lot of science fiction and fantasy\n",
      "mystery to them, where the explanations don't remove that? How did that work for you? Yeah,\n",
      "go ahead. STUDENT: I feel like this was achieved really\n",
      "well in the first Mistborn book. BRANDON: OK. Well, thank you very much. Your\n",
      "check's in the mail. STUDENT: Not spoiling it for people, but at\n",
      "the beginning of the book there's expectations and there's an explanation of certain aspects\n",
      "of the world and society that are lived in, so that the reader buys into it. Like, OK,\n",
      "this is how it works. So a great twist is for them, the characters and the reader, to\n",
      "then find out, \"Oh, no. We were lied to.\" BRANDON: The \"Oh, no. We were lied to,\" to\n",
      "the readers is dangerous but very effective. A couple ways to do this is to-- the easiest\n",
      "way is to hang a lantern on it. This is a stage term. I don't know where it came from.\n",
      "It's where you have a character specifically say, \"These two things don't look like they\n",
      "go together. Oh, well, they obviously do.\" That's you saying to the reader, \"Hint, hint.\n",
      "Something's wrong here.\" But a lot of times you can do it more subtly\n",
      "by showing two aspects of the magic or world that don't jive together, to the point that\n",
      "they start to form a kind of clash, a dissonance where these things aren't in harmony. Then\n",
      "the reader starts to subconsciously look for an explanation to stretch for why special\n",
      "relativity and general relativity don't mesh yet, or something like that. Like, where's\n",
      "our unifying theory? And then when one pops up, the reader's like, \"Oh!.\" That's a way\n",
      "you can build some mystery into it. But you can also, generally a good way to\n",
      "leave some mystery, is to say, \"Here is your one little segment of the world you're going\n",
      "to understand, Harry, but there's so many other things that people are doing. You're\n",
      "just at school. You're a first year. You're going to learn these three spells. But don't\n",
      "worry about all these other things that people are doing.\" And that kind of, like I said,\n",
      "J. K. Rowling does a pretty decent job of balancing, in the Harry Potter books, this\n",
      "sense of wonder and a sense of internal logic. She does not maintain internal logic between\n",
      "books, which drives a lot of people crazy. That's where J. K. Rowling had-- When someone\n",
      "says to you, \"Why didn't they use a time turner for this? Why don't they use a polyjuice potion\n",
      "for this?\" Her internal logic per book tends to be really solid. You get this sense that\n",
      "you're getting just enough explained that the characters can solve problems with the\n",
      "magic, but you don't feel like all the mystery is gone. It just breaks apart a little bit\n",
      "between books. But I give those books that benefit of the doubt. I just say to myself,\n",
      "well, the kids just don't understand why they can't use a polyjuice potion here, or why\n",
      "time turners. They just didn't explain that to them because they're dumb kids, and things\n",
      "like that. I allow myself that because J. K. Rowling\n",
      "does such a great job with internal logic of a given book, that in some ways it's too\n",
      "much to expect those books to also have the internal logic of Lord of the Rings, which\n",
      "has really excellent internal logic. You just have to read a lot of The Silmarillion. It\n",
      "also has great internal logic in the actual published books. Lord of the Rings is a gold\n",
      "standard for how to use magic systems, like I talked about before.\n",
      "But those are just a few ways. Anyone else have any ways that they have maintained mystery\n",
      "or seen it done? Yeah, go ahead. STUDENT: I was just going to say, and this\n",
      "kind of tags along with what you were saying, kind of just a variation of it, but focus\n",
      "on what the characters know. Focus on seeing things from their perspective, and that allows\n",
      "the world to seem so much bigger, because it's around you.\n",
      "BRANDON: Yeah. This is the advantage of a third person limited. In case those online\n",
      "didn't hear, he said focus on what the character knows and seeing the world through their eyes,\n",
      "and you can maintain a sense of grand scale and mystery, while still having them have\n",
      "a little bit of control over their immediate situation. A third limited is just wonderful\n",
      "for this. Yeah?\n",
      "STUDENT: In the first Borne movie, Borne identity, it starts off with him on the island with\n",
      "the doctor, and the doctor studies him and makes basically a list of Borne. Look at all\n",
      "these things you can do, including having him just mentally [___]. So you know that\n",
      "he has these capabilities, but you don't know where or how he got them.\n",
      "BRANDON: That's an excellent example. I'll repeat that. In the first Borne movie there's\n",
      "a doctor who studies him and says, \"Here's all these cool abilities you have, but we\n",
      "don't know where you got these different abilities.\" This actually answers the question before.\n",
      "There's a great story that has a magic system that's not a magic system. Because the magic\n",
      "system is going to be Borne discovering his memories and why they get them back. If you\n",
      "do it in a very logical way that someone says, \"Hey, if you do this you'll start getting\n",
      "your memories back,\" that's a magic system. Fulfill this thing, do this thing, get this\n",
      "reward. And then the character starts to get his memories back and learn why he was able\n",
      "to do these things. At the end it ties very strongly into why he lost his memories, what\n",
      "happened, and who he was before, all kind of converges on a single kind of character\n",
      "arc and plot arc. It's a great example of a magic-less magic system.\n",
      "All right let's go to next question here. \"Do you change or modify rules based on the\n",
      "age of the intended reader?\" I'll add to this one I know that's later in the list, which\n",
      "is \"Do you, while you're writing, ever change your rules?\" Let's talk about modifying rules.\n",
      "I think the person is asking, do I modify Sanderson's Laws, or do I modify how I use\n",
      "magic systems when I'm writing for different age groups. Generally, I do not. There's this\n",
      "really fine balance between writing down to an audience and writing specifically toward\n",
      "an audience. It is a tricky thing to navigate. Generally-- let's just put this on the board\n",
      "so you guys know where I'm coming from. Generally, in the publishing industry, children's books\n",
      "are 18 and under. So when we say children's fiction, it includes YA. That is a difficult\n",
      "thing for a lot of people to just get used to that terminology, because YA, not children.\n",
      "But that is how the industry talks about children's books. When a publisher has a division between\n",
      "adult and children, children's is everything 18 and below.\n",
      "Now we have YA in here, which is covering about age 13 and up -ish. A rule of thumb:\n",
      "Age of your protagonist plus 2 is about the age group you're intending the book for. That's\n",
      "why you see a ton of 15- and 16-year-olds. People will generally read about someone older\n",
      "than them, and they don't like reading about someone younger than them. Rule of thumb.\n",
      "These are very loose rules. The Golden Compass is a great example of something just kind\n",
      "of breaking all of these rules and just ignoring them. They get shelved in three shelves in\n",
      "the bookstore because no one knows where to put it.\n",
      "But around 13, so this dividing line right here, there's a very big divide. Down here\n",
      "we call it middle grade. There's a big dividing line right here that's different based on\n",
      "the age of the reader, where the teen stops reading books that gatekeepers give them and\n",
      "start picking up books that they have chosen. That's usually seen as the fuzzy line between\n",
      "middle grade and YA. That's why you just kind of think about--\n",
      "the other kind of fuzzy line there is romance. Like, middle grade, it's like romance needs\n",
      "to be kind of puppy love-ish, and maybe a little hint here and there. They are curious\n",
      "about it, but they don't really actually want a romance in their stories most of the time.\n",
      "Or if they do, it's a very kind of Disney romance. There's no actually romancing going\n",
      "on. It's just the state of the world has become secure that these two have now formed a couple.\n",
      "We know that that's supposed to happen. Those are kind of your two big things, and\n",
      "that divides middle grade and YA. And then underneath it are, and there's some transitional\n",
      "books in here, but then we kind of go to the chapter book sort of thing. Then underneath\n",
      "that, I am not an expert on, so I'll refer you to a different teacher to talk about the\n",
      "nuances between board books and picture books, and the easy-to-read books and things like\n",
      "that. Yeah?\n",
      "STUDENT: What about new adult? BRANDON: New adult has not become a thing.\n",
      "I'm glad you brought it up. There was an attempt at creating a new thing here that was like\n",
      "18 to 22 called new adult. This was just the children's publishers looking to have another\n",
      "audience. It has just not become a thing. You might be able to find people online who\n",
      "disagree. But my experience has been, the last five or six years, publishers just stopped\n",
      "asking for new adult and stopped trying to make it a thing.\n",
      "Already, the line between YA and adult was really getting vague, at the upper end YA.\n",
      "AS an example, Steelheart is shelved in YA in the US and in adult sci-fi/fantasy in the\n",
      "UK. That's the just publishers deciding, \"Ah, this is where we think it goes.\" You see that\n",
      "in a ton of upper YA. It's like, where is this line? Trying to put another line is there\n",
      "is generally, in my experience, not worked, but your mileage may vary. There may be publishers\n",
      "who think it worked fantastically well. My publisher, when I asked them about new adult,\n",
      "they're like, nah, just didn't become a thing. So good question.\n",
      "Where I kind of reside is I haven't really written underneath middle grade. Middle grade,\n",
      "if you're wondering, Harry Potter is a good example. It starts in middle grade and then\n",
      "ends in YA. Hunger Games is YA. Fablehaven is middle grade. Just kind of some touchstones\n",
      "there for you. You do have kind of an important division\n",
      "right here. YA is not edited for content. Some editorial lines do edit for content.\n",
      "Like, if you're publishing with Disney, they are going to edit for content. But most editorial\n",
      "lines do not edit YA for content. That means they do not edit out swearing, sexuality,\n",
      "or violence. A lot of people have an impression that YA is edited for content. They mean middle\n",
      "grade. Middle grade is edited for content by most publishers, which means that they\n",
      "will try to get the middle grade to have less of an R rating, if you've written an R-rated\n",
      "middle grade for some reason. Yeah?\n",
      "STUDENT: Do you ever have publishers or editors try to have you put more graphic content in?\n",
      "BRANDON: Okay, question. I get asked this a lot. Have I ever had editors or publishers\n",
      "try to get me to put in more graphic violence or sex? No. This does not happen. It happens\n",
      "in romance, specifically, if you're writing erotica. They may come in and say, \"We need\n",
      "another sex scene right here.\" That has definitely happened. You will occasionally get, if you're\n",
      "writing an action thriller, be like, \"We need an action scene.\"\n",
      "But this is a perception that people generally have outside the publishing industry about\n",
      "the publishing industry, and that's just not the way the publishing industry works. They\n",
      "purchase a book from you because they like that style of book. The editor's job is going\n",
      "to be to make it a better version of that book. I've never had an editor even mention\n",
      "saying, \"Oh, could we have more sex scenes?\" or things like that.\n",
      "I did have Moshe once ask me, he's my editor at TOR, he's like, \"Are Vin and Elend sleeping\n",

      "usually given to young adults. Young young adults, right? But it's usually read by people\n",

      "you are breaking some weird rule of external logic, some weird sort of--\n",
      "Let me give you an example here. This is going to be a weird example, but it will relate.\n",
      "I once read, I was reading a book, I think it was John Keegan's History of Warfare, where\n",
      "it talked about the theory that horses early in the classical era had not been bred to\n",
      "be strong enough to carry a rider on their back, which was part of why chariots became\n",
      "such a big thing. I'm paraphrasing a very complicated anthropological discussion. But\n",
      "this idea was, I loved the idea of, wait! Horses pulling something rather than having\n",
      "something sit on their back, you could have smaller horses and things like that.\n",
      "So I wrote a book where you couldn't write the horses because it would break a horse's\n",
      "back. Every reader's like, \"These stupid people. How can they not have tried riding a horse?\n",
      "You can obviously ride a horse. Why are entire cultures saying this stupid thing?\" It took\n",
      "a lot of work to convince them that realistically people couldn't ride these horses because\n",
      "it would actually harm the horses. Readers had in their head that horses are something\n",
      "you ride. Therefore, this rule breaks my external logic of this thing, even though it was actually\n",
      "externally logical in the first place. That was something that taught me, if you're\n",
      "going to go against people's expectations, you need to put extra work into it. You generally\n",
      "want to do this, because once you've done it, it gives you control over your story.\n",
      "I think that the internal logic is more important than the external logic, but you do have to\n",
      "realize that sometimes you're going to have to be upfront with a little more of your world\n",
      "building, which raises your learning curve. Basically your best choice is to find shows\n",
      "where you can show this working in the world, that will really imprint in people's brains.\n",
      "Like for instance, showing someone ride on a horse's back and it is hurting the horse.\n",
      "And then people remember, \"Oh, that's what happens,\" rather than just having people say\n",
      "it a lot. You run into this if you are using real world\n",
      "mythology. Because even though it doesn't have, real world mythology you have to pretend\n",
      "it has an external logic. People know what a vampire is. When we were talking earlier\n",
      "about magic systems without magic systems, stuff like that. People are like, okay, vampires\n",
      "suck blood. They are turned aside by garlic and crosses, yada, yada, yada. If you aren't\n",
      "having your vampires act like that, then the longer you go in your book without explaining\n",
      "how your vampires work, the harder it is going to be to disabuse people of their expectations\n",
      "for vampires, and indeed they're still going to forget, even after you've taught them,\n",
      "unless you're very careful about it. This is important to do because it's probably going\n",
      "to be plot relevant to you. But you have to realize there's just more\n",
      "work to do in doing so, which is often why you see the fantasy books that'll use things\n",
      "that are elves but aren't elves. They just have a different name. So it's like, these\n",
      "aren't Tolkien elves. They're 95% Tolkien elves, but there's one thing that's very different,\n",
      "so we're just going to call them something else and try to reinforce to you what that\n",
      "difference is. Yeah, let's go to the next question on the\n",
      "list. All right. Spoiler questions about one of my books.\n",
      "\"Is there a way to see hard magic disguised as soft magic in a book?\"\n",
      "Yeah, it's very, very common. Do realize that the readers interfacing with a story element\n",
      "is going to be the most important thing. If you've got a-- for instance, Anne McCaffrey.\n",
      "Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern, she insisted her entire life was science fiction\n",
      "and not fantasy. All right, you know. She added a bunch of external logic to explain\n",
      "how the dragons worked and things like that. She worked very hard to explain this as science\n",
      "fiction. Everyone who read those books thought of them as fantasy.\n",
      "Because the way the reader interfaces with the story is actually more important than\n",
      "what the author says about said story. I'm totally okay with Anne being like, \"No! These\n",
      "are science fiction.\" You can say whatever you want. You can tell people all you want\n",
      "about your stories. But what they experience is way more important than any of that.\n",
      "If you are having a hard magic disguised as a soft magic, you've got to treat your book\n",
      "like a soft magic book, not like a hard-magic book. Though you can obviously make that transition\n",
      "over time, which is a very fun transition, as people find out the things that were illogical,\n",
      "that seemed soft, get explanations and become hard magic.\n",
      "Fred Saberhagen's Books of the Swords, which are very fun stories, it's been a long time\n",
      "since I've read them, but what I believe happens in these books is a bunch of people from earth\n",
      "that are very advanced with science fiction technology go to a planet where there are\n",
      "humans and decide to be their gods. You only find out about these gods through secondhand\n",
      "accounts and things like this, as you slowly, through the series, realize, \"There's a reason\n",
      "why this mythology just sounds like our earth mythology, is the people who are these gods\n",
      "are just science fiction people who decide to go play god on a planet.\" Again, it's been\n",
      "a long time, so I could be misquoting Fred's entire lore there.\n",
      "But I've seen that sort of thing before, where it's like it's not magic, it's science, but\n",
      "the people doing the science, it's-- Who's law is that? It's Clarke's Law? Any sufficiently\n",
      "advanced science will seem like a magic to people who don't know about it.\n",
      "So yes, you can definitely disguise a hard-magic system as a soft magic system. Just realize\n",
      "in most cases you need to treat that like a soft magic system because that's how the\n",
      "reader is going to experience it. \"How do you prevent world building from feeling\n",
      "like a chore?\" Ooo, discovery writer here. Most of the time when people ask this, they\n",
      "are discovery writers. And I would recommend to you, write your book and don't stress it.\n",
      "Finish your book, and then decide what world building things you actually need to expand\n",
      "upon to tell the story that you have already told a little bit better. Do all of your world\n",
      "building, for your first book at least, afterward. If you're feeling like world building's a\n",
      "chore, don't do it yet. Do what makes you excited to write your story.\n",
      "Then after you're story you'll get done and you'll be like, all right, I really need to\n",
      "understand these religions a little better. But most discovery writers will have filled\n",
      "in a lot of that as they're going, because they get excited by seeing through the character's\n",
      "eyes and stuff. You can do a lot in post, so to speak, where you add all this stuff\n",
      "in. You only get into trouble when you are then doing more books in the series and you're\n",
      "going to have to stick to what you put in the first book.\n",
      "So if you are a discovery writer, and that idea is very daunting to you, make sure you\n",
      "build in a bunch of mysteries that the characters don't understand yet, that you don't understand\n",
      "yet, that you can have fun exploring and extrapolating upon in the next book, so you have that same\n",
      "sense of eagerness, and then just make sure after you finish the book, you get some early\n",
      "readers, find out what they're confused by, do your world building to fix that.\n",
      "Understand that, in general, any process that you use to arrive at a published book, readers\n",
      "generally, if you're doing your job right, won't be able to tell what your process was.\n",
      "In fact, I had a really interesting conversation with Cory Doctorow once where he said, \"It's\n",
      "really interesting that readers generally can't tell which chapters took me six months\n",
      "of sweat, blood, and tears, and which chapters I wrote in an afternoon and they were great\n",
      "on the first try.\" That's because the process of publishing and revision is built around\n",
      "this idea that by the end you're hopefully having a consistent quality, and the things\n",
      "that are really hard, or that come out really rough in your first drafts get smoothed over\n",
      "until the point that it is a finished piece of art.\n",
      "If you're a discovery writer, or if you're some weird hybrid between, which really most\n",
      "of us are, don't stress about this. Do what makes you excited to write the book. Finish\n",
      "the book and then ask yourself, all right, what does this really need in revision to\n",
      "make it better? STUDENT: How do you do this if you're a hard\n",
      "outliner. Say that you have a plot and character, but you're like, well setting and details,\n",
      "and do I really want to explain how this works, kind of thing?\n",
      "BRANDON: The thing about it is, you can hybridize these things really easily. Try to pretend\n",
      "that it's not, like, one camp or the other. I bet there are a ton of people out there\n",
      "who come up with a pretty solid plot and characters and don't world build at all until they're\n",
      "done with the book. At that point you kind of have to make a few decisions based on what\n",
      "do you want the feel of your book to be? How much world building and lore do you want there\n",
      "to be? How much of this is a selling point for your book?\n",
      "There are lots of great books that don't spend very much time on the lore world building\n",
      "aspect. A lot of these are kind of your David Gemmell-type gritty, or the kind of modern\n",
      "wave of the Joe Abercrombie-style books, where it's like, who cares about the thousand years\n",
      "of history and lore, or this thing. I'm telling a story about this one person going and doing\n",
      "this one interesting thing. In that case, you can just say, this isn't a selling point\n",
      "of my books. My selling point is something else. I'm just not going to do it. I'm not\n",
      "going to worry about it. That's okay. In fact, that's advised. Do what is exciting to you.\n",
      "Now, give your book to readers. See what readers are wanting more of, and you don't always\n",
      "want to give it to them, but you can acknowledge, OK, they're confused here. We need a little\n",
      "bit more here or things like that and use the tools to write the story you want to write.\n",
      "But just like in visual arts, not every piece of artwork needs to be an incredibly realistic,\n",

      "you can say which one you like more, but I don't know if one is more art than another,\n",
      "if that makes sense. Create the type of art you want to create,\n",

      "need it, and only put in as much as you feel like you need. For the rest of you who are\n",

      "enough. No. No, no, no. The whole theme of this class is, nothing is absolute, and I\n",
      "am going to be wrong some amount of the time. Sanderson's Laws have worked very well for\n",
      "me, in order to help me create the types of magic systems I like to create in books, and\n",
      "I think they have interesting applications to storytelling in general that are worth\n",

      "worried that you're going to be doing this, that this will happen, that when you're writing\n",
      "your story you indicate that there are holes in the magic. This is really handy, particularly\n",
      "if you're going to be writing in a series and you don't know exactly what you're going\n",
      "to be doing in your series, saying, \"You know what? We don't understand this aspect of it.\n",
      "It's something else.\" Example of this in Mistborn is when I have\n",
      "Sazed use his magic, feruchemy, I have him use it mostly offscreen, and I have him use\n",
      "it in a moment that is kind of a violation of Sanderson's First Law. if you haven't read\n",
      "the book, Vin is unable to escape something that is happening, and rather than suffer\n",
      "the consequences, Sazed steps in and saves her.\n",
      "Now, this works on a couple of levels as a reason. Back then I didn't even really know\n",
      "Sanderson's First Law. But even still, I would still have done this sequence the same way.\n",
      "One reason is, it's in the middle of the book. The purpose is not to give you a satisfying\n",
      "resolution to Vin using her magic. Vin is new at the magic, and it's mostly Kelsior's\n",
      "fault that she's in this trouble in that scene anyway. She does not deserve to pay the price\n",
      "for Kelsior's foolhardiness in this situation. And so I don't feel like it's pulling back,\n",
      "pulling punches, by having someone else, who's her other surrogate father figure in the series,\n",
      "show up and save her when Kelsior's abilities fail.\n",
      "Beyond that, mostly this is here as an introduction to Sazed having powers that we don't understand\n",
      "that are going to be relevant later in this book and very relevant in future books. So\n",
      "having this moment to introduce that idea was more important to me than making Vin get\n",
      "out of this specific situation on her own, because it was well beyond her ability to\n",
      "get out of anyway. So in that situation, this whole sequence, which is violating Sanderson's\n",
      "First Law, but not really because I added in the \"satisfying.\" \"It's not satisfying\"\n",
      "gives me a catch-all for violating my own rules. But it does something else. What it\n",
      "does is say, hey, there's mystery to this other magic system that we're going to explore\n",
      "later. That is a really great way to do this. But another great way is to foreshadow things\n",
      "going wrong. How many times have you-- like they do this all the time in superhero comics,\n",
      "where it's like characters starting to manifest new power. We have them start to do it early\n",
      "on. I mean, they just did it in the new Star Wars movie. They knew they needed to have\n",
      "a certain character perform a certain feat with the Force later in the movie that had\n",
      "not ever been used in the Force in the movies before. So they put in a wounded snake.\n",
      "What's that? STUDENT: It did in The Mandalorian.\n",
      "BRANDON: It did in The Mandalorian, but The Mandalorian was made after this movie. It\n",
      "also existed in the video games and stuff, but it hadn't been in the movie cannon. So\n",
      "they were like, \"We're going to put it into the movie cannon early in the movie, so later\n",
      "on when we need this special Force power, it has been used a couple of times.\" You put\n",
      "this in early, then use it later. In fact, you can always do that in post.\n",
      "In fact, there's a piece of me that believes, I haven't asked this, but there's a piece\n",
      "of me that believed that they got the whole movie done and they're like, \"You know, this\n",
      "whole Force power comes out of nowhere. We should really add a scene where someone uses\n",
      "it early on and discovers how to use it.\" And they're like, \"Yeah, giant snake.\" And\n",
      "Baby Yoda. But you can't have television continuity. That's a separate-- they are the same continuity,\n",
      "but it's a separate viewer experience. Your viewer experience should not have to depend\n",
      "on a different viewer experience. Regardless, it happens all the time in comic\n",
      "books where the characters, like, they're trying to shoot their web slinger, but it\n",
      "does something weird, and they're like, \"Why is this not doing this like it's supposed\n",
      "to? Something's going on.\" Then later on it becomes a plot point, and then they figure\n",
      "it out, and then they use it to solve the problem. If you don't want to violate Sanderson's\n",
      "First Law, really all its saying is do your groundwork ahead of time, or in post.\n",
      "I actually write sometimes; you guys will love this. Any Bill and Ted fans in here?\n",
      "If I ever run into something where I've added in something that I know I should have foreshadowed,\n",
      "but I don't want to go do it right now, I put in brackets \"remember a bucket.\" Because\n",
      "there's a scene in Bill and Ted where they're captured and they're like, \"We've got to remember\n",
      "to go back in time and put a bucket right up there.\" Then the bucket falls, and they're\n",
      "like, \"Yeah!\" I just tell myself to remember the bucket, and then when I'm doing revisions\n",
      "I'll go back, and I'll add in the bucket. All right let's talk briefly, for 10 minutes,\n",

      "the ways you do it is this. Now, this is really, really important, because I think that a lot\n",
      "of people who write science fiction and fantasy come to it from a world building background,\n",
      "and you spend a lot of time on your world building. You think about how cool it would\n",
      "be if X, Y, or Z happened. You come up with a creative and innovative magic system and\n",
      "all of these things. But a magic system is only as interesting\n",
      "as the people using it. An action sequence is generally going to be meaningless if you\n",
      "don't care who lives and who dies. Not always. There are some that the spectacle of the action\n",
      "scene itself is what propels you through it. But in general in a story, if you don't care\n",

      "that all of these other pieces mean something, is really important, and one of the most important\n",
      "things that you want to learn how to do in your writing.\n",
      "Now, character is one of these things that for me, I had a lot more trouble talking about\n",
      "character when I started teaching. And even still, the pieces of what makes a character\n",
      "work are a little more ephemeral for me. I, as a writer, I've told you before, I generally\n",
      "outline my setting and my plot ahead of time, and my characters I cast, meaning I say, all\n",
      "right, I'm going to try writing a character in this world. I'm going to see where this\n",
      "person goes, what their passions, and dreams, and hopes, and fears are as I write them,\n",
      "and if that works, great. I'm going to keep going with that, and that becomes my character.\n",

      "gotten so that I do this less and less. But I still, like for instance, my two big series,\n",

      "done in description or in introspection, so it is a step forward, and once in a while\n",
      "you're just going to have this, because it's basically a monologue disguised as a dialogue.\n",
      "But this is a less effective way to do it. More effective is generally when you have\n",
      "it look like a conversation. Bum, bum, buh, person starts to launch into, em dash, gets\n",
      "interrupted by other character who says, \"Wait, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\"\n",
      "And this character says, \"No, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" And then this\n",
      "character says, \"Oh! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?\" And this character's like,\n",
      "\"Yeah.\" And then another part of your info dumps. Then this other character's like, \"But\n",
      "what about this other thing.\" And the character's like, \"We considered that. The blah, blah,\n",
      "blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" And you are breaking your info dumps up and making it\n",
      "into a conversation. This is just going to read way better, and it's going to give you\n",
      "way more opportunities to make your dialogue feel like it's expressing character.\n",

      "are just shooting the breeze and talking together and stuff is coming out, having a variety\n",
      "of different types. And in the same way, the character who always asks for more information\n",
      "can have a variety of ways they do this. The idea is never to have the reader and these\n",
      "sorts of things really pick out, this is the character that always asks for more information.\n",
      "If you do your job right, they would be able to tell that this character is talking, but\n",
      "they wouldn't be able to tell you why until you say, well, they often are asking for more\n",
      "information, or this is the character who is empathetic to how other people are feeling\n",
      "and always asks the person who is being quiet in the conversation what they think. And if\n",

      "on that subconsciously, and that character's dialogue is just going to feel like their\n",
      "dialogue. The king way to show off your skills in this\n",
      "is to do dialogue-only sections and to practice them without attributions. This is very hard,\n",

      "else. Oftentimes you say something in introspection, but you show something else through dialogue,\n",
      "description, beats, and action, and that contrast between the two, that dissonance, is what\n",

      "really need. I use noted way more often than I probably need to use it, because it's basically\n",

      "before you added a beat or another dialogue. But generally, if it's just two people and\n",
      "it's quick back and forths, you want to scale way back on your tags. If there are three\n",
      "people in the conversation, or even another person in the room, it's often better to use\n",
      "more tags than you think you need, just because that third person, it's going to be jarring.\n",
      "But, yeah, that's a-- Like, if you were reading a novel version\n",
      "of some of this Joss Whedon quippy dialogue between two characters, most of those shouldn't\n",
      "have dialogue tags at all. This goes also in the adverb direction. \"He\n",

      "use a couple of them to modify tone, like softly or loudly or things like that. Some\n",
      "people will say just take them all out. This is a personal stylistic choice, again. I think\n",

      " BRANDON: Right. So that's a beat, and we're\n",
      "going to get to those. That's what a beat means. Variety there is really handy. The\n",
      "reason beats are also very good is because a beat, like for instance, \"He slammed his\n",
      "hand on the table. 'I am done talking to you.'\" Then you don't need a shouted, you don't need\n",
      "a he said. We all are framing that, and it also does this kind of pyramid abstraction\n",
      "stuff where we're grounding you in the scene and keeping you there.\n",
      "This is also a stylistic choice, how often you use beats in your dialogue. Some writers\n",
      "like a beat almost every line of dialogue. Some writers like to keep only as sparse number\n",
      "of beats as they can in order to keep you grounded in the scene and who's talking and\n",
      "add some variety to the said and asked. Personal stylistic choice.\n",
      "I find that if you use fewer beats, just like you use fewer adverbs and things like that,\n",
      "that you are naturally going to force yourself to write better dialogue, and the reader's\n",
      "going to be adding more of those beats in themselves. But this is a stylistic choice.\n",
      "Basically, it comes down to if, as you as a writer, how much do you want to be painting\n",
      "a cinematic picture in your readers' heads and giving them every single action, and how\n",
      "much do you want to back off on that and have them be imagining it themselves. This is also\n",
      "going to vary, based on your genre. Some genres like more, some genres like less.\n",
      "Also, it's going to depend on how much you want that dialogue to pop. You can imagine,\n",
      "on the page, how different it's going to be if you read a scene that looks like this.\n",
      "Short dialogue, short dialogue, short dialogue, short dialogue joke, short dialogue. Now change\n",
      "that just in your mind to beat right here. “He went and scratched his face.” And\n",
      "then beat right here. “She sat back, folded her arms, and cocked her head.” Beat right\n",
      "here. Beat right here. Beat right here. Instead of reading like bam, bam, bam, bam, rapid\n",
      "fire, you're going to get a slower scene. You're going to get an introspective scene,\n",
      "where you're seeing characters. You're stopping the reader from focusing on the dialogue and\n",
      "you're pulling them into what the characters are doing, and you're making the subtext more\n",
      "important than the text of the dialogue. These do different things. Generally, I recommend\n",
      "erring on doing less with beats, but there are definitely sections where you want to\n",
      "pull out from the dialogue and actually be talking about the subtext and stuff like that.\n",
      "You'll see some fantastic writers, like Frank Herbert will do this, where it's like, what\n",
      "you're really doing is you're showing the character giving commentary on all the dialogue\n",
      "and things people are saying, and the purpose of that scene is more to characterize the\n",
      "character who's giving a running commentary, either in their head or to someone else about\n",
      "the dialogue, and the dialogue itself becomes less important than that commentary, because\n",
      "the purpose is to show that this is how this person is.\n",

      "feel that all tools available to a writer are good to use now and then. So I am a fan\n",

      "very often in prose fiction in the market right now. Italics and bold mean the same\n",
      "thing generally. You can make a distinction, and some writers do. But I would say most\n",

      " when plot and character meshed together and oftentimes it's a little bit of a revision process to make sure that alignment is working in rhythm of war which I'm writing right now I had a character that the the plot all worked but I felt like there wasn't it wasn't the right character beat and the third revision finally kind of made me find a character beat that worked for this character in this case I changed the character's journey a little bit so that it dove tailed into the plot in a better way and it feels really satisfying when you find that but yeah how much time do I need to devote to a secondary character to make people care there is no set limit this is a good question you can I say some writers some\n",

      " filmmakers can make you care about a person with just a short and brief scene I've found myself in films caring for a character who and it doesn't even have a line of dialogue if this person is presented very accurately I remember for instance that in the comic books again in the death of Superman storylines after Superman died back in the 90s there are a lot of people who tried to take up his mantle and the one I remember the most is the one who had the least screen time it was a guy who had a hotdog cart and started giving away free hotdogs while wearing a Superman shirt he's like this is how I'm going to be Superman and that's you know that just stuck with me right that's a character who I think had like three panels or something like that maybe I'm remembering wrong but doing something very brief to add a lot of rooting interest for a character can make a secondary character very powerful to us in a very short amount of time what does\n",

      " it mean exactly when you say add a viewpoint this is in context of the I believe where I was saying if you need to lengthen your story you add a viewpoint what I mean by this is a viewpoint character generally in a book the number of viewpoint characters you have is going to greatly influence how long your story is a viewpoint character is a character with your whose eyes we see in a first-person story this is going to be the eye you can have multiple eyes in a story in a third limited which is what I generally spend more of my time writing this is just someone else's head that you're in now I'll make the caveat here that occasionally writers myself included liked to jump to one person's viewpoint for a short period of time one chapter and you're not gonna get a lot of characters are a lot of viewpoints through their eyes usually this is to add flavor to the world or to show a plot point you can't normally show or to just show a scene from someone else's perspective while all the other characters are there just so you can do something new with it but each time you get through someone's into someone's eyes you're going to have to start establishing rooting interest or sympathy or you know antipathy if your antipathy I'm sure how to say that word you're going to want to establish this character in the readers eyes and that's going to take some extra words then using a character you've already used you have to establish the way that they think about the word world which is going to use extra words and if you actually want a this to be a solid viewpoint character you're gonna want to create an arc for them either an internal arc or an external arc or multiples of each and you're gonna want to have a sequence of viewpoints that shows them working toward their goals or in otherwise changing which just adds another parallel dimension to your story you can imagine this if you were watching a movie that was about teenagers going to school and about a young woman who is trying to join a sports team and her arc is this whole get in on to the sports team get on to the soccer team how that would be a story if you are going to add a viewpoint you perhaps add the coach's viewpoint and you're showing the coach's home life and all the things that are going on in her life and how things are difficult for her and how you know all of this and suddenly you've got a second storyline but then meets the dovetail into the first storyline in some way by the ending to make it feel cohesive and you can see that that just adds a lot of extra work but also it adds a lot of extra depth and changes your story dramatically now if instead of showing the coach's story you were showing the team captains story and this team captain has a different story it changes your book in a different direction so adding viewpoints is one of the ways that you sculpt the story and the way you're doing it how do I character development happening at a steady rate instead of too much at once are not fast enough this is practicing with your beta readers in your alpha readers this is not one of those things that I can give you a formula for very easily but this is one where you're going to just have to just can have to look at it you're gonna have to try it you're gonna have to see what works for you generally you're gonna want every scene with that character to either keep establishing you know their motivations or to show them changing in some way ideally every scene shows something like this they make a step forward or backward both in their emotional plot their internal plot in their relationships or their external plot in some way and also is helping ground their motivation even further and doing that in every scene if you can and watch what readers say watch what T readers talk about this is where your pacing comes in how quickly are you moving us through the progress toward your promise is what pacing means or at least one of the definitions of pacing how do you write characters that have mental illnesses that you don't know much about you come to know about them I highly recommend for topics such as this\n",

      " that so what our top is just this these are topics that if you do them poorly and you your book you can it you can do damage to a group of people for instance by in accurately representing mental health issues you can in your book help to isolate people you can make people feel worse or you can sway the public opinion in ways that are harmful because of this this is one of those issues that you should be really careful about I don't think you should avoid doing it this is where maybe I difference different opinion from some others who have legitimate suggestions that you just right about things that you don't have personal experience in for me writing is about exploring the world in the human condition and for me to do that in a way that is anyway satisfying to me I have to have every character explore being something or someone different from how I am and this is just part of my my writing foundation and so because of that I'm gonna get some things wrong and you're gonna get some things wrong and you are going to accidentally do damage so be aware of that do your best to avoid it by doing your research going to primary sources and asking them reading their blogs reading their biographies reading about them the things that they write about their life in any of these sort of situations and then make sure you get some people from that group to read your story pay them if they are an expert's or in other ways try to get people to read your stories and give you feedback so that you can know this is just something I feel that if you're going to approach these issues you take upon yourself as a burden as a writer that is part of your responsibility how do you keep character voices different\n",

      " you kill characters so it's kind of an interesting thing for me because I often take a little more of a philosophical approach to this one a lot of writers you'll talk to they say my characters my characters and I just let them do what they're doing and when I first started writing I thought this was complete luck I'm like now the characters do what I write for them to do I'm a novelist this is what I do but at the same time I can understand that particularly in characters taking great risks I as a writer kind of view it as I am going to not withhold the consequences some of the times sometimes I will of characters taking actions that could cause their deaths and I feel like when a character death is a direct consequence of actions taken by them or other characters in the story it is going to come across it's going to work lots of times in life stories our deaths are not direct consequences they're often indirect consequences and stories those tend to be very unsatisfying when you have a giant war epic and your protagonist general dies of dysentery on the battlefield it's a very difficult story to write in a way that's going to be satisfying that's challenge if you want to do it but most of the time that character dying as a result of the decision they made to have a battlefield in a certain place or as a decision another character made to betray that character or something like this is going to be a more satisfying story to tell because that's how we do storytelling now you're going to have to decide how you want this death to work what are you wanting the death to achieve so it's a very different thing if a character fulfills their arc and in fulfilling their arc decides to take a risk or make a sacrifice and die because of that that's a very different story that's a very heroic story it's a very kind of classical Hollywood story a different sort of story is the character is about to complete their arc and die right before it this is hugely unsatisfying which is something you can use as a tool in your storytelling I have done it before George Martin is very very good at this this idea of leaving you hanging in a way that all of the character are left hanging because they thought this characters Ark should be completed and it didn't get completed this is a very dangerous tool to use readers do not like running across this very often unless you've already established that this is a theme of your story and it becomes a plus instead of a minus how else do you kill characters making it a direct consequence of the actions of the antagonists is always a great idea if you are going to be killing characters in your story there are a lot of great ways to do this however you need to ask yourself what result do I want to have why is this character death happening in my story how can I make sure that it is not feeling tropi but it's feeling like the real death of a character that and understand this is going to have real consequences and on reader emotions and how what do I want it to do as a story piece that is a difficult balance to walk because on one hand I'm telling you make sure it doesn't feel like the author just playing with figures on a table and knocking one over and this and while on the other hand I'm telling you you are an author playing with figures on the table and deciding to knock one over it's about the illusion it's the illusion of this is all real don't let them see the author's hand when they see the author's hand then you have generally made a mistake software I use to keep everything straight all right\n",

      " I know when my character is too competent with 7os so character competence becomes a problem when things are supposed to be difficult for that character and they aren't now things not being difficult for the character doesn't have to be a problem is the thing this comes down to the tone of your story and what people are wanting to get out of your story for instance having a story that is a mystery where the detective is extremely competent and the fun of the story is watching the character the detective step through the discovery process is really fun this is Sherlock Holmes right why was Sherlock Holmes loved by everyone shock Holmes was incredibly competent and you just got to watch him solve a problem through the course of that story now if the story were more about Sherlock Holmes as a character as a lot of the modern adaptations are then these stories tend to focus on the areas of incompetence that Sherlock Holmes has while balancing it with competence so for instance if Sherlock Holmes were also emotionally very stable and great at relationships and had everything together in his life then the modern adaptations would not be as interesting because they're expanding to other areas they're not just about can he solved this mystery modern adaptations tend to be about can he solved this mystery while maintaining a relationship with Watson while his own life is falling apart because he's a sociopath right or something like that in this case competence in one area is balanced by incompetence in another if your character is competent in all areas you can still have a story that's engaging it's just a very different type of story it's gonna be we're gonna enjoy watching the character go through the motions we are not going to connect or empathize with that character generally as much but this can still work you just have to decide what type of story you're telling in general most writers myself included would recommend balancing areas of competence with areas of incompetence to give yourself more tools to tell a more varied story but it is not the only way to tell stories Adam do you have any questions for me all right how do you make a an iconic\n",

      " villain terrifying instead of cliche so um anytime so how about this a cliche is when a story is doing something that it's done it's been done so many times that the original purpose of the cliche has been lost and replaced with kind of the pop understanding the collective understanding of it for instance the original purpose of a villain giving a monologue at the end of their story is to fill the reader in on details now when a caret-- villain does that a significant portion of the audience says oh they're monologuing again that reminds me of that other story where they make jokes about that isn't that funny and instead of paying attention to getting the information the readers are instead remembering another story in getting the wrong mood applied to your story that's why a villain monologue is generally a bad idea now now of course it was probably always a bit of a bad idea but it's especially a bad idea because of the cliche so if you're asking how do I prevent a villain from being cliche this becomes you asking yourself all right what has the cliche been replaced with what was the original intent what is now what's going on but if the villain is cliched because a lot of villains these days you would say why are they cliched it is because they are OneNote they want\n",

      " the questions from last week let's see these are not formatted quite as well so okay let me do a few of these and then how do I make two characters who have opposing goals equally sympathetic especially when one of them is clearly on the road to villainy so we talked a little about this right now I want to dig into this idea just a little bit more and say putting them at contrasting goals is really really handy this is a just a great way to make a villain but you do ask the question of how can you make them both sympathetic they should both want what they're going for and make the achieving of it mutually exclusive meaning if one gets it's a zero-sum the other one can't get it and then you just show why they both want it right if you show their motivations if you should let us see why they need this thing then it will work for itself it'll work itself out if we have we understand their motivations and their motivations are sympathetic motivations meaning their motivations that a normal person would have one of the reasons that villains get cliched is this sort of I want power which is kind of nebulous like yes people want power but really in our lives what we want is I want this promotion so that I the work I'm doing I'm respected for yes getting promotion does give you more power but how then there seem to be very few people are just like oh ah I want power the more they're along the lines of I could do this job so well if I just could cut through the red tape if I can get to a higher level then get this promotion the red tape goes away and I can make it done the way I want it to be done and that would be great because everything will run more smoothly that is a realistic motivation as opposed to I want the promotion for more power and you know spend a little bit of time and ask yourself why a person would want to do this and you know two characters going for the same promotion one of them wants it because they feel like they can legitimately just make the world a better place and the other one wants it because they're there you know they need an expensive type of surgery that if they can't pay for they will die you have two contrasting motivations only one of them can have the promotion obviously there are ways around this but you see what I'm doing suddenly we're sympathetic for both but there's one that we want to succeed a little bit more this is how you go about things let's see\n",

      " how do you know which metaphors are appropriate when you're writing about a fantasy world that shares elements shares many elements of the real world oh you've got a problem ahead of you here well it's a problem in that I can offer you solutions but you're gonna have to make some difficult decisions this is the translation problem is what we call it basically you're asking when readers are reading my book and you'll have your character put their feet up on an ottoman do you call it an ottoman when the Ottoman Empire never existed in this fantasy world even though the fantasy world is very similar to earth in a lot of other ways you ask yourself can you say it is the straw that broke the camel's back without people saying wait a minute that's a saying in our world I know they have straw and camels in this world but they really come up with the exact same metaphor it's even worse if there aren't camels or you haven't introduced in that and you're like they're like wait wait wait they're camels in this world I guess there must be but that's just very very weird to me you have all kinds you can go down a rabbit hole in this for instance in Miss Warner I use a lot of Greek and Latin word derivations in order to create the fantasy words that I'm using for the names of the magic systems because in our world we use a lot of Greek and Latin so you end up with something like allomancy which you know Mansi means to see the future it also is a thing that sounds like a fantasy magic and so when I use the word allomancy am I saying that Latin exists in this world and that elements actually means what the Latin means or I might it you can go down a rabbit hole you'll have to make your own decisions here on what you decide to do I use something that Tolkien said and I'm paraphrasing him horribly but basically the idea was the books are translations from an original tongue and the translator has interpreted sayings into things that a modern Western audience reading in English would understand and so if Bill happens to say something that you're like wait a minute wait a minute there's no Ottoman Empire that is just the translator who is translated it into English and therefore using the word that is most similar this is what I usually use as my excuse for this it's being translated English and the translator is Brandon Sanderson and he is going to use some terms from our world now and then but even in saying that you have to be careful particularly in a fantasy work with how much you kick the reader out yes they can go through the thought process of that the one that is kicked people out of the books the most is when I used the term homicidal hat-trick for a character who had killed three members of another characters family and I just love the term so much I put it in even though my editors like this will kick people out and I'm like yeah but I like it and then indeed it is probably the phrase that has kicked people out the most because they sitting they think all right hat-trick means this it's a sports term do they have sports on this world what are they doing where they come up with this that sort of thing it is been you know it's one of those things that even if you're in the right right there is no right it's a fantasy novel right but even if you're in the right there can be the question of if you kick your audience out or a significant portion great you're right your story still works worse than if you were wrong and so sometimes it's better just to trim these things out but you're gonna have to make that call yourself Adam let's get a question from the audience right\n",

      " right character for the right plot in the early stages of developing a story hmm boy I do a lot of this on instinct I'll try to break it down for you generally I am doing in the early parts of my writing some free rights from the character's viewpoints sometimes these end up in the book sometimes they don't I posted for you the beginning of skyward where I did three different introductions to this character and the this was me searching to make sure I had the right character for this plot almost always as a writer you can make any plot interesting with any character with skill it is very rare that I sit down and after writing for awhile say man this is the wrong character for this plot because if you're doing your job right then the plot is often catching people who are not well suited to the story that they're in and forcing them to go on the adventure anyway that's what a lot of stories are about you are a fish out of water you are the person who has to save the world but you don't fit that narrative and as you write who the character is will influence how they decide to go through this story and if you're doing your characterization right the reader will be like yeah this totally feels like how this character would go about saving the world and that back and forth is what makes writing stories really fun and engaging so I would worry about this less than you probably are considering you're asking a question about it that said once in a while a character doesn't fit they are the wrong character this happens when a character for instance is distracting from another plot they are so usually it's somebody who's very curious right like their plot is super interesting but it doesn't align with the main plot and you bring them into the story and suddenly every reader wants to read about this character instead and they're not focusing on your main story that's when you have decision points we're like maybe this character should Bend the hero from the beginning or maybe this character needs their own story and I need to put someone in that that role who better folds into the group dynamic that I am creating for this ensemble cast that definitely does happen now and then but it's almost never do I think oh the character is the wrong character for the plot the most I've ever done is do what I did in way of Kings where I split a character in half and made two different characters out of them Dallin are in a delenn as I've talked about before so that that could split apart the motivations for the characters and the goals of the characters and have them in conflict with each other instead of the calm like internal in one character so let me take another one of these these are yeah\n",

      " books exist solely to show that these two characters have a background together this is when you have the character meet another character and they share a joke about Budapest right this happened in the it happens in the Marvel films you're like these characters have banter they have a history they know each other and are friendly to each other and go it can be also conflict driven where these characters have not gotten along in the past dialogue can achieve that dialogue can be there just to make the reader laugh or to make the reader cry to inspire an emotion in the character a lot of of characterization or a lot of dialogue in films is there to just be a joke now this is often doing multiple things it's making the reader laugh it's often advancing the relationship of the characters and it is often providing a break in the pacing of a you know tight action sequence or some other thing to give you a chance to feel another emotion for a while because one of the things you want to avoid in your stories generally is you you want to avoid always being at at end this is this can be a big problem I suppose I can write because we did all this stuff on the board if your story is always like this is your characters emotional graph right and this is time and this is how emotional they are on this topic and your story is like this this character is angry and they are always at attendent this is going to have it's gonna be bad for your story this is going to lead to that OneNote character problem that we talked about a couple of weeks ago it's going to lead to the reader feeling fatigued about this character and about the high emotions that are happening in it you are also going to feel the story is stagnating because there is no motion now of course if this character is having a time where something makes them a little angry but then they get over it but then something worse happens and they try to get over it but then spikes up and then this is where you know Hulk smash your story has motion your story has ups and downs your story is going to work better this is the same sort of thing with action if your story is at a 10 for action the entire time you're going to have fatigue in fact it generally is even the same way for tension and pacing now on pacing wise I will say that I have read shorter books that keep the pacing at a 9 or a 10 the entire book and it works for me because I read it in one sitting and then I'm done and then I'm like that was a page-turner those books if they ever get long enough that I have to put them down at the end of it I feel unsatisfied because I've been at a 10 or a 9 the whole time for you know characters this happens a lot in thrillers put it down come back and like how it's still at a 10 right this is getting old this is just not working so that's a matter of length of story I often feel like I can keep the pacing as a writer faster and the emotion higher in a shorter work than I can in a longer work in a way of Kings book I'm trying lots of ups and downs I'm trying a steady ramp of a lot of these things but then lulls where we have scenes where characters are just sitting around the fire chatting and having fun and remembering how much they they enjoy being around each other to give us a relief from some of the moments of tension do you have another question for right okay all right let's talk about humor um I would recommend to you that you go to some humorous and listen to what they have to say Howard Taylor my friend and writing\n",

      " excuses co-host um talks about humor in excellent ways and he is a better source than I am though I do know enough about this to start talking about it a little bit and so let's talk about humor humor works best either as a relief from some other tension as a way of creating character familiarity or division between characters or particularly humor works best when there's a lot of different types of humor humor is tough because humor is one of the most subjective things you will put in your book what you find funny is going to often be more distinctive to you than what you find exciting generally excitement and some of these emotions are more broad-based humor tends to be a little more individualized and the other thing to keep remembering cluded is the readers investment in your story has a large effect on whether something feels melodramatic meaning overly a sentimental or dramatic just regular dramatic you can see this by picking up a very dramatic story and reading only the ending and when you don't have connection to the characters it will feel way more sentimental to you a lot of times then if you are reading the book and it's a well-written book and you are getting to the end and you've been on the journey with these characters where you're like wow this emotion is earned therefore I'm going to let myself feel it emotion doesn't need to humour doesn't need to be earned as much as the other ones do so let's talk about a few aspects of humor so there are a couple of broad categories of humor you can use and these tend to be good at tends to be good to add a variety of these right so one of the large categories is what we call the comic drop the comic drop is where you are taking a person who is a high level of respect competence self-respect arrogance you might say and you are dropping them through a comment made by someone in the story or by a situation if you've ever seen a story where someone talks where a character's like I am so great and awesome I just succeeded they didn't say that like the character holds up the trophy that they have won and then like you know an egg hits them in the head right this is like complete undercut of the emotional moment by dropping that character from a place of security and strength to a place of being laughed at and the comic drop is one of the more useful types of humor you can you understand though that if you drop somebody who's already low that will actually drop the person making the joke more than it drops the person this is what we call about punching up or punching down when the person is standing on top of the podium and they have been victorious and they get an egg in the face that is very different than the person who is walking away slumped because they didn't finish the race because you know they tripped and fell and then someone throws an egg at them that characters not that character is being dropped a little bit but the person who threw the egg is the one who is really gonna get our ire so where do you use your comic drops is is one of the things that you can control you can also show banter between characters a lot of banters between characters involves a comic drop of some sort it involves a character laughing in another character and then coming back with a nice comeback that drops them a little bit but in a way that makes everybody smile even the character smiling so you the reader can feel like you're in on the joke you're all together and you're having fun when lopen glues his face to the floor and everyone laughs lopen has dropped himself this is one of the things Logan does here this is why one of the reasons he's an endearing character is he's willing to drop himself and have fun with it and laugh at himself and so in some ways he's doing a comic drop we are laughing at him and we're liking him more in the same situation so another sort of humor is the juxtaposition juxtaposition so things that don't\n",

      " belong together juxtaposed are often very funny this is the source of humor in a lot of the the movies that you'll see about you know he is a strong tough cop and his companion is a six-year-old with you know in a Tinkerbell outfit or whatever the idea of these two things alone are not necessarily funny but these two things together make us laugh your comic just juxtapositions you do have to be careful about because a lot of comic just a positions are going to by their nature make your story funny rather than making your characters funny a comic drop is generally done by the characters or people in the story and it's its humor that's in the story but for instance that story I told you you would not expect that to be a really tense drama about a character getting over you know some difficult thing in their life you'll probably add a little bit of that but you'll understand that the reader is mostly going to laugh about these two paired characters who do not get along the comic juxtaposition can just be used in joke form as well but again the more you use it the more jokey it can make your entire story again I am NOT an expert in this and so a lot of things I'm going to be saying don't fit into the big theme there people can talk about this thematically a lot better but is the rule of three this goes along with juxtaposition that a rule of three the idea for that I should stand away from it so you can actually see it on the board the idea of rule of three is that when you show things happen in a sequence you are going you are going to be expecting some sort of tying together of these thematic elements and or some sort of reversal for the third one and so for instance you can use the rule of three to to have a list of things where the third one is a juxtaposition or where the third one is a comic drop or where the third one is something that is finally you know the expected one and in example of this see if I can buy an example so example of this there is a there there is a an old Bruce Willis movie that is really weird called what's the Hudson Hawk so weird if they tried to do a really a comedic action thing and they strayed a little bit too much into chucks position and comic drops on Bruce Willis's character to the point that nobody knew how to take it it played a little bit like The Last Action Hero if you've seen that where I actually think Last Action Hero works really well whereas Hudson Hawk is like fascinating but one of the running jokes in this is this idea that he wants a cup of coffee right and every time he goes to take a cup of coffee get his drink of coffee something happens to the coffee and this kind of plays into a play on the rule of three means repetition repetition with\n",

      " some little variants in the repetition is innately funny to us so Bruce Willis goes to get a cup of coffee and the first time something mundane stops him right I can't remember what it is in the story so we'll just make up around the first time he he gets his cup of coffee he accidentally leaves it behind the second time it's a little sillier right he goes to get his cup of coffee and this time someone else walks by and takes it and starts drinking it the third time you do something completely ridiculous I do know this what is in the story he picks up his cup of coffee and someone shoots the cup out of his hand and it explodes right and so because we've done the repetition Bruce Willis can't have his coffee and because we're seeing this idea of the the rule of three I don't think the coffee thing in that movie is actually a thing I think it goes far beyond that but the idea is that escalation makes humor the more you escalate this thing the more interesting it becomes and one thing to be aware of with humor is that you want to start small with this escalation for the same sort of reason that if it's always up here it's always completely crazy then you you're not going to enjoy it as much as if it starts normal a lot of times if the situations are really crazy at the end of the stay in the story your buy-in is much lower but if it starts normal and then gets ridiculous by the end you are buying into very very insane situations a lot of what we kind of call the comic farce the you know like the Chevy Chase vacay movies the way these work is by starting with a small little thing that is going wrong and then the characters bumbling inability to deal with it escalates the situation to something that seems normal then this seems a little less normal and then seems completely outlandish but since each step is very small we are laughing at how Chevy Chase is able to top how ridiculous the situation is each given time but so couple of couple of things to help you I really would point you toward other humorous do realize that there are also kind of general themes of humor there is what we would call let me erase this guy and I try to\n",

      " who has started what we call or is running what we call an imprint back in the day 6070 years ago these were all independent publishers they would start up a business usually named after themselves and they would be acquiring books and publishing these days almost all of these are owned by 5 the big five publishers though there are some very large book companies that are not part of that for instance scholastic is not part of the Big Five and they are very large publisher but generally everything is under a big one the big publishers and a lot of these imprints are mini little shall we say cities in the publishing Empire so in a big company like McMillan which is one of my publishers there is an imprint called tor books which was founded by Tom Doherty back in the late 70s early 80s was run as a separate independent publisher for a while and then acquired by Macmillan in the 90s Tom Doherty is still the publisher of that imprint at tor a publisher is primarily a business person and they have several people underneath them that you probably should know about they have what's called an editorial director they have editors and they have acquisitions editors and there's also sometimes VPS or you know assistant publishers different types of names so what is this doing basically your publishers job is to handle the business side of things and the editors job is to handle editorial the editors job is to acquire books for the publisher to publish now what you should understand is that these roles are often held by not held by separate individuals depending on the company for instance at tour for many years Tom Doherty was also the editorial director Harriet mcdougal was the editorial director at first she retired it became Robert Jordans editor only and his wife and Tom Doherty basically became the editorial director an editorial directors job is to oversee the editors to make sure that they are doing their jobs basically middle management in charge of editors an editor's job is to work with an author in ways we'll explain later to take the book to make it better to perfect it and kind of be basically a project manager sorry barely read that editors kind of like a project manager their job is to oversee each project which is a book and an acquisitions editor is somebody who reads through what we call the slush pile slush pile is all of the submissions that have been sent in to the publisher the people who want their books to be published and the acquisitions editor reads to them and finds books that they want to publish now at tour for example and a lot of companies these are not two separate jobs much of the time indeed a lot of times the editor is the acquisitions editor or the editor has an assistant whose job is to help them with all of their work and will also act as a partial acquisitions editor for them and that the assistant will not be acquiring themselves they'll just be looking for promising manuscripts to give to the editor that the editor might want to my editor at tor Moshe fader was the assistant to another editor for many years helped him with acquiring books and with editing them and then eventually was told you are allowed to now acquire for yourself and then motion went out and started to look for authors to acquire for himself and moved up into being an editor so this is just useful to know about the publishers you're submitting to to know which imprint has who is their publisher at Random House which publishes my team books we have a basically editorial director slash publisher all wrapped up in one who is not the head publisher but is in charge of a small group of editors her name is Beverly and she doesn't acquire she just manages these editors normally the people in this position are going to do much less acquisitions in fact they may not do any once in a blue moon a friend of Tom's would want to publish a book and Tom would would read it himself and be like you know what I really like this if it's tour he would then assign it to one of his editors and say you become the editor on this project I don't believe that Beverly over it at Random House Delacorte is the imprint there that I published with does any acquisition herself she just oversees everyone else once in a while an editorial director will have their own line of books they're publishing while they're overseeing everyone else and that fact that was the case with Harriet at tour before she retired from that position so it's useful to know because this will influence who you're sending your books to who you are targeting and who you want to buy them for instance at tour approaching Tom Doherty directly is probably not going to work for you like I said once in a while one of his friends or someone he knows or some some contact you will make him say you know what I'm gonna acquire this book but most of the time at tour you're gonna be looking for directly at the editors and trying to pitch your books to them how do you do that well this takes us into kind of Phase two this over here we'll talk about how books get to these people and they come through to general format our avenues one is agents and one is direct over the years that was a really weird way to write direct print over the years publishing has moved less direct and more agented this has been a continual trend that began decades ago and is still a continuing trend that more and more publishers are saying on their submission guidelines that they do not take on agented submissions the big shift in this as I understand happened really in the 80s and 90s where agents started to shoulder more of the burden of reading slush and picking out the gems and sending those directly to the editors this is how most books I would say these days are sold traditionally is that an author picks up an agent the agent then takes it to all the editors in town pitches the book to them picks and gets offers back goes back to the author and says here's our offers what do you want to do in these sorts of things direct still happens I sold direct I sold a Elantra to tour books in 2003 through a submission directly to an editor that I had met at a convention that was Moshe instead of having an agent I was submitting to agents at the same time but I sold directly now one of the questions that arises a lot regarding this is should I be hunting an agent should I be going direct as I said direct is actually getting harder and harder to do most agents will say to you and most editors probably as well will say your best bet is the hunt an agent first don't submit the book to editors directly the reason they say this is because if an agent picks up a book then finds out you've actually submitted it to every editor already and they've rejected it that agent will feel like this book has already gone through the town and is therefore soiled good I don't know it's like they can't sell this book that's the fear that they have I will tell you a contrasting opinion of that I think that that opinion is wise and valid there is an argument for\n",

      " sending directly to editors I might be survivorship biasing this one because it worked for me but my argue to myself was always I might as well double the number of places I can send books to and if it turns out that an agent picks up a book that I've already sent out a bunch well then they will have better avenues for selling that and get the get the editors to take another look at it or I will just give them a new book because I write quickly enough that if they feel like this book has already seen the town well then if they're willing to pick up one of my books there's a decent chance because I write so much they will like the other ones as well in fact an agent is not looking for a book they're looking for an author agents generally want to represent an author during the early part of their career and then reap benefits later in fact this whole industry for most of its life has been focused on this idea the idea that a new author is a money-losing proposition in most cases for a publisher a brand new author takes time to launch a brand new authors first books are generally not going to sell a ton of copies and it's over time with that author establishing a fan base that becomes then that author becoming popular that is what they are looking for so in general through the course of the history that's what they wanted and I'm a good example of that Elantra sold fine it did just fine but it wasn't probably even paying the bills for tour in the long run but Mistborn the whole trilogy ended up selling better and then the way of Kings ended up doing even better and suddenly I am one of their best-selling authors in fact I think I might be tour's best-selling author and because of this now those books are extremely profitable for tour when early they lost money on me so in ideal world everyone is looking for authors to build up over time the unfortunate about this is over the years this has become less of a theme and it's become more bestseller driven what do I mean by bestseller driven so for a long for for most of entertainment let's just say this and most of entertainment the the pieces of media that do highly successful business pay for all the risks you take on ones that don't sell as well and then you will have something in the middle called the mid list in books a midlist book is a book that makes money for the publisher pays for itself but doesn't make so much that it's really funding anything else these are successful books by career authors who have a dedicated fan base but not a huge one these people were very important to publishing for many many many years because them an aggregate would be as much money to the publisher as their few headliners of which they'd only have a couple and so keep maintaining a really strong mid list was a very important part of the business however some things have happened one is in the publishing and indie publishing has began to bite in out that mid list quite a bit take big chunks out of it because generally if you're a mid list author it is more profitable for you to independently published than it is to publish with a publisher this is because all of if you have a small consistent fan base that is not growing but is also not shrinking then and they are willing to buy every book you put out you don't need marketing budgets you don't need huge marketing campaigns you can directly target that audience yourself and you can sell to them and you will make a much better cut of the money doing that and because of that a bunch of people who would be miss Lister's are now indie publishing because of that publishing has said well we need to focus more on the hits we need more hits the other thing that happened that caused this is some consolidation in the book industry when a lot of the small bookstores folded and the large conglomerate change took over which was a big process happening through the 80s and 90s into the 2000s what happened is a lot of niche bookstores that were very good sellers for midlist vanished for instance there would be bookstores in the past Tom dougherty tells the story of it's not even a bookstore it's like the corner store the truck stop let's say he often used this one so the truck stop exists and in that truck stop there are a bunch of truckers come through who really like westerns and Tom dougherty could publish a few midlist Western books and he could get those into those truck stops and his bulk of his audience was these truckers who would buy them well during the 90s what happened is books started to consolidate into only the big bookstores and the truck stops stopped being able to sell as many books because people were going to Barnes and Nobles and things and what was happening is that some of these niche markets were drying up the distributor's where it wasn't worth their money to go to all these little chains anymore and put these books in because it was just so much overhead to hire all those um those people that even though there was an audience for those books those books were no longer profitable or as profitable as sending them all to the big corner bookstore which then was going to be more hit driven plus a lot of your markets started getting picked up by places like Costco and things like this where you weren't selling niche books you were selling very hit driven books someone going to Costco is looking for the nude and buck they are not looking for the new niche western book that a lot of truckers might like but there's a small enough segment that is just not profitable I could go into this for hours trust me I'm just giving you a summary I'm getting some details wrong on this but the end result was the publishers feeling they needed to be more hit driven and so they started to focus on let's buy a book see if it explodes big if it doesn't explode big we drop that author and put another author in that slot because the book that has come out yet has that chance of being really huge very rare chance but it has a chance once an author is a known quantity there's this sense that a midlist urn will remain a mid lister and that there are some upper echelons or like cut those mid Lister's let's look for more hits this is fallacious you may be saying wait a minute do men Lister's never become bestsellers George our Martin was a quintessential mid lister all through the 70s and 80s and became the biggest epic fantasy writer in the business in the 90s and the 2000s great example of someone who had a long career with some dedicated fans and then wrote a book that just connected with everybody and it spread from those fans like wildfire to the rest of the world so I think you know personally in the long run this old method is still better for writers readers and authors but that is not necessarily how some executives think about it so be warned hit driven is kind of a thing now let's go back to this sort of thing and let's talk a little bit about agents for you and then we'll talk about direct publishing yourself and this is going to answer some of your questions that are popping up so what is an agent agents are people\n",

      " pros of agents what they're gonna do is they do all that legwork they're one of their primary jobs is to know in person all of the different editors at all of the different publishers and the books that they have released recently and things they've said about what they're looking for by the way never ask an editor what they're looking for quick tip ask them what they bought recently if you ask what they're looking for they won't want to pigeonhole themselves because they wouldn't want to exclude a book that they don't know they're looking for yet that is really fantastic so they all hate that question but if you say what's the most recent book that you acquired by a brand new author and why did you acquire it much better question to ask an editor gets them talking about what made them pick up this book and and that sort of thing and granted you don't always want to send an editor the exact thing they've just acquired because they just acquired that so they won't need another book just like that but it can be really handy to get a feel for what the the editor likes editorially alright so agents do all that legwork they're going to lunch with these editors they are meeting them at you know cocktail parties they are keeping lists of who's bought what recently all that stuff an agent is also a negotiator when you get that offer from a publisher the agent is an expert in contracts specifically publishing contracts they will know what's what should be in a contract and I should put in here contracts they will know what you can argue for and what you can't argue for as a new author or at least how hard it is to argue for things you can ask for anything anything you can argue for what you're likely to get they'll know they will know your worth as an author because they will know you know edit our publishers need books if this is all like why this is so hard understand you have something they want even though you're a brand-new author they need books to publish they can't rely on Brandon Sanderson forever because Brandon Sanderson is eventually not going to have books for them anymore hopefully not for many many years but they know this they need what you have so you have innate value to the publisher and the agents will know how to exploit that value to its fullest extent to negotiate for the best deal they also can offer editorial an agent a good agent often knows how to help an author make a book work better for the UM for the editors and can do kind of a first editorial pass to fix things that might turn editors off at the beginning and help them want to pick up the book so with all of these things why would you not want an agent well let's talk about the cons not conventions but cons\n",

      " of having agents number one is they take 15% they take 15% of the two off the top of every contract in fact the way that most of the business is done the the publisher sends money to the agent who takes 15% out and sends the rest to you now this can be a slight advantage in consolidation of ioin of your money for instance at the end of the year I get from my agent a summary of everything we've gotten and basically a 1099 from them saying here is all the money that we have paid to you in one easy form for taxes but this can also be a con sum once in a while doesn't happen often once in a while an agent is and it has happened that authors have been not paying attention to what their actual in money in was and agents were taking more than they should again very rare but there are some people who don't like agents say if you do get an agent make the money be split at the publisher and not in the agent the publisher sends 15% of the agent and 85% to you full disclosure I do not do this it sounds like a huge hassle for the publisher and I do trust my agent but this is a legitimate concern about agents and one reason that people do not like agents another reason that people don't like agents is they do not want editorial as agents have become more and more the slush pile that publishers are are that people are submitting to and that they are then sending on to editors sometimes there is this conflict of interests where the agent feels like they don't want to submit anything but the best work they can find so that those editors will always be trusting to this agent only submits the most high quality work and therefore the agent you know goes to the top of the slush pile because of this agents will sometimes run of authors through many revisions on a book looking to get it editorially just as the agent wants it and on some people and I think this is a very legitimate concern who don't like agents will say that's not the agents job the agent job is to sell the book the agents job is not to be the editor of the book and if an agent is holding a book back from submitting it because they want it to be something it's not then that's dangerous because what if the agents opinion is wrong they have it revised all this other direction and the editors would have liked it better if it just would have been submitted some people say just submit the book don't go editorial you're gonna have to decide for yourself if you go traditionally traditionally published how much editorial you want from an agent and how much you're willing to take from an agent some agents for instance will not pick up an author until they've gone through a rounds of revision with every author to see if the author is willing to revise and is good at it some authors that's just not what they look for in an agent so be aware of that and there is this sometimes other conflicts of interests\n",

      " for instance let's say an agent could spend an extra couple of weeks negotiating on your contract and bring it up from getting ten thousand dollars in advance to say 20 thousand dollars and that agent looks at that and says my 15% on an hourly basis of the amount of work I would have to do to get this from 10,000 to 20,000 dollars is just not worth that hourly rate I should just tell the author to take the 10 grand whereas for you 10 grand to 20 grand as an advance could be the dividing line between you being able to go full-time at this or not so sometimes there's this conflict of interest with agents and good agents will acknowledge this and we'll kind of have a blanket our job is to get the best deal for our author regardless of how much time it takes as long as the author wants to keep pushing because otherwise we run into conflict of interest levels and this is why I based a lot of what I think a good agent does on what Joshua does Joshua is willing to spend months negotiating a contract for $500 for foreign rights on a book because it's kind of a matter of principle that he doesn't violate that he is always looking for the best deal for the author because to not be looking for the best deal the author leads you down this path of of madness so pretty legitimate gripes that people don't like about agents a lot of indie published people do not use agents at all if they do use agents they use them for another Cobb bonus than agent tab which is overseas overseas sales are very hard for you to sell on your own most indie authors I know do not sell overseas and in translation usually that is the age job the agent will take your book and we'll have deals with a lot of agents in other countries and they these agents in other countries will be already have a deal that anything the US agent picks up the agents say in France is going to accept as a client and try to sell in France this can be really good money particularly new as a new author one of the advantages we have in writing in the English language is that English language entertainment is generally entertainment leader worldwide just like French wine or you know German or Japanese cars have a reputation English language entertainment has a reputation for being very high quality and we benefit from that in that a lot of our books are able to be sold in many different countries for some times small deals but an aggregate make quite a bit of money for us this isn't to say that other countries don't have really vibrant and great local publishing enterprises of their own a lot of them do but this is an advantage we have plus the English language market is just so big that starting English language and going to smaller markets generally makes a lot of sense because if you are for instance or writing first language and you're writing in a language where there just aren't a lot of book sales then your advances will be so small that you can't live on it but if your English language and then picking up extra money from other sales I it can be it can work much better so regardless your agents one of their jobs will be to sell these books overseas and even before my first book came out Joshua had three deals for me overseas before the book was published and this is just a thing that agents tend to be very good at because it also makes a lot of sense for them to have their authors all around the world so let's go ahead and talk about some of the questions that we have here regarding agents and up until this point all right so and then we will dig into what happens when a book actually gets an offer on it okay so when do you give up on finding agent only when you decide that you want to go indie published as long as you want to be traditionally published you should be looking at getting an agent if you have these problems that would be another reason to not get an agent you should not give up on an agent because of rejections you should give up on an agent because you legitimately have problems with these sorts of things and don't think you want to use an agent it is still possible very hard but still possible to do and there are some indie authors who use an agent only for overseas contracts or things like that or you have decided to indie publish which we'll talk about next week there is a good argument for being what we call a hybrid author which is an author who's open to both avenues and I will talk about being a hybrid author next week as well all right so should agents\n",

      " vanity presses are this segment of the book publishing industry that exists to charge you money to publish your books this is different from indie publishing and any publishing you're in control and you may pay for an editor you may pay for a for a cover in fact you should do both of those things and that is legit that's what you should be doing a lot of these kind of vanity presses they'll act like they're a traditional publisher some bad agents will exist simply to funnel people into them they'll say good news we've accepted your book all we need is $5,000 in order to publish your book these are people you should run away from full speed an agent who sends to any of these places is not a legitimate agent or at least as it is a legitimate agent with huge ethical problems going on and these publishers are not people that can do what you want them to do there are a very very small number of people that Vandy presses actually serve legitimately in my opinion and this is someone who has a book that they want to publish so they have lots of copies of it to give to their friends and family but who is not looking to make a career out of publishing there is a small chance that also a celebrity who does their book and wants to sell it like like let's say you were a rock star and you want to have a book for sale at your at your concerts to sell with like your CDs and things like that Vande publisher probably is a decent option for you but in most of these cases indie publishing the book on your own can be done print on demand so you can order as many copies as you want to sell yourself there'll be a very high price point you won't make a lot of money off of those print copies but the e-book copies you will be able to make money off of there's no reason to go with a vanity press from the majority of people you should just instant investigate indie publishing which again you will have to pay for but you do not need one of these vanity publishers and so stay far away if you want to read more on them there is a website that for a long time was maintained don't know if it is anymore\n",

      " called writer beware which was maintained by SIF WA the science fiction writers Association America where they would list a lot of things about why vanity presses were just not recommended a lot of them have have died off in the era of indie publishing there's still a bunch of them around but a lot of them have died off another warning sign is an agent who is asking for eternal revisions on your things without actually sending them out an agent who says you put your book out on submission but isn't willing to actually sit tell you the names of the editors they submitted to which imprints they're at and is not willing to send you the rejection letters that's a warning sign they should be willing to do all of this stuff an agent who asked for a lot of money up front bad the only thing an agent should ever charge you for is like sometimes postage right and even then my agent never charges any money he will take things out of what he sells like if he sends a bunch of books overseas it's part of our contract that he can charge the postage of that to me and that comes out of money that I've earned it's never more than a couple of hundred bucks a pay period and it's just like really minuscule and again I'm never paying any money it's coming out of other things so watch out for agents that are asking for money watch out for agents that are asking for reading fees watch out for agents who are too aren't who aren't publishing books right who up they don't publish but you know I mean who aren't selling books to legitimate publishers that you can find in the bookstore here's the bottom line if this publisher or person you want to work with if you can't go to Barnes & Noble and find their books on the Shelf not orderable but on the Shelf you don't need them you can do indie publishing and you can do everything that those people would do for you on your own and you probably should if you can go and find a book by a new they're picked up in the last couple of years on the shelves at Barnes & Noble already they're not have to be ordered in then chances are good that's the legitimate publisher slash agent if they represented that all right okay who how much time do we have left about 15 minutes all right so we are going to break down what happens when a book gets acquired all right and I'm gonna go fast through this part because we only have 15 minutes left because we got a bit of a late start show the book gets acquired this is great what happens is first there's an offer and this is usually of an advance an advance from a publisher is money up front that is a loan against the money that book is going to earn for you over time it is a loan that does not need to be paid back if the book does not earn enough money it is a loan that needs to be paid back if you do not deliver the book or something like that happens all right an advance will be offered usually advances for first-time authors are around 10k they range between 5 and 20 okay but last time I saw one of the polls that said what did\n",

      " you get on your first book it was around 10k so this is $10,000 up front it's a even a little bit worse than that because usually this 10k is split between half on signing and half on publication which means that you're going to get 5 K of that when you sign that contract once in a while it's 1/3 on signing 1/3 on turn in and acceptance of the book and 1/3 on publication sometimes it's even split by paperback so there's a fourth one 1/4 on publication of hardcover 1/4 on paper publishing a paper bag I think that's where mine are now because my advances have gotten so astronomically huge that the publisher wants to space them out as far as possibly possible how I do advances get um they can go all the way from here up to ten million um is about what you see that like the highest that you're saying for anyone except for the really big kind of rule breaking authors like the your JK Rowling's and stuff like that so it's anywhere in there how do they know what to offer on a book if it's by a new author well this is where as my agent puts it imaginary numbers come in not the actual mathematical sense but what will happen is the editor will go to the publisher and say I really like this book I think it's really good for our line we should publish it and the publisher sometimes working with the marketing director and other people depends on the on the the publisher the imprint will get back and say alright how much do you think it can make and the editor will say I put this sheet together it's called a P&L profit and loss sheet that assumes this book does as well as this other book that we published by a new author that's kind of similar and based on those imaginary numbers that we've made up I think we can offer $20,000 on this book and the publisher will be like great that's your negotiation negotiating that's like your high end you can start negotiations below if they're demanding more than that you need to come back and renegotiate with us sometimes that imaginary number will be like we've hit the zeitgeist we can offer up to a hundred day on this right or whatever they they just kind of decide now how they know partially about this is if the book has been up for what we call a\n",

      " bidding war this is if the agent gets a book that they think is really hot like wow this is fantastic this is by a new author everyone's gonna want this they will send it out to all the publishers and instead of what normally happens when you submit you submit to the a off publisher they have they take like six months to a year to review it and get back to you it's this really miserable wait it was 18 months I waited for launchers to come back to me instead the agent will say we're taking offers in two weeks we we expect this to sell really fast and suddenly everyone goes crazy like wow this agent has a fantastic book they all go read it the agents supply agents try to keep a good reputation because an agent have a good reputation for books in the past can't get away with this as easily they all read the book and let's say they all like it then they all get back and they start making their offers and then the agent goes back to them and says well these people offered 100k and that's you know we don't you know you've got to have to beat that and so this other they'll can't basically play them all off of each other and eventually arrive at a high number now there's some interesting things about advances you\n",

      " hey everybody welcome to class uh this is our next to last class this will be another fire hose session i apologize for that but it is going to happen uh we will slow down next week for our last week where we will i will do q a on publishing questions from you so hold your questions um and then please write them into the forums that you are going to fill out saying that you were here for this session all right and i will use be using that list and last week's list to answer what you guys need to know um this week i want to thank in particular jennifer peale and becky monson um these two are the students i have this year who are professional romance novelists who took the class because they wanted to try something new and learn some fantasy and science fiction uh they're both indie published and they have been an enormous research source for preparing this lecture they were going to give this lecture in class but with social distancing and things like that we just decided to have them send me their notes um which i am going to incorporate into this lecture it's really handy to have notes from people who are doing it in the trenches right now so let's talk about indie publishing this week by the way our main topics will be indie publishing and then what contracts look like in traditional publishing along with royalties and things like that which will be comparing to how things work in indie publishing so brief and overly simplistic history of indie publishing back in the day if you wanted to be independently published it was really hard some people still did it and were successful uh famously the christmas box was an independent book back in the day aragon was a uh an indie book back before the um the big change ever happened in about 2010. uh but during these days most of the time indeed publishing was synonymous with what we call vanity publishing uh which the two are distinct but the line blurred a lot more back then vanity publishing would be you go to a press you pay a bunch of money you are your book is published but you get five thousand copies which you store in your garage and occasionally give away or maybe sell i had somebody who was a friend of my parents when i was growing up who had done this um they were a newscaster who had a story about a golfer they wanted to tell they wrote it they got it vanity published and then they sold three or four hundred copies of the five thousand copy print run that they paid for and the other five thousand copies sat in their garage um this was unfortunately the um the average story for someone who tried to indie publish back in the day the problem being that warehousing shipping and distributing physical medium is really hard and requires a lot of connections or a lot of fame or your own model the people who are most successful with indie publishing back before the digital revolution were people who had a way to sell their books themselves for instance they were giving lectures or seminars on something and they would have their book for sale there they will have indie publish their book and then would sell it there or they were someone who you know sold at an expo doing something else and also had a guidebook on the thing that they were doing i knew somebody who you know sold alpacas in alpaca wool who had indie published their book which was a fantasy novel about talking alpacas and sold it at their same booth these sort of things could be successful but for many years it was really hard and because of that it also picked up quite a bit of stigma uh stigma which was likely undeserved then and is very undeserved now that indie publishing was not real publishing um well something happened in 2010 um the digital revolution finally hit books now this was a long time coming and long enough coming that people were uncertain if it ever would actually hit books because it had hit music it was hitting television and film people were moving to digital for things like music but people resisted that and continued to want print books um and then uh the kindle launched and in the space of the year the whole landscape changed it like everyone had been waiting and holding their breath and they'd started to think well maybe and then it just it all came rushing through so what happened is uh you can actually i could see it on my royalty statements my royalty statements went from a handful of ebook copies being sold the air just tiny numbers you know earnings and they're like your ebook earnings this uh this quarter were 53 dollars to suddenly 20 to 30 percent of my business moving uh digital in one year uh this was a huge revolution in the industry um it has continued over the years though ebook versus print has stabilized across the last three years or so with the only growth segment of of it being audiobooks right now audiobooks are still growing print and ebook meaning audiobooks is still swallowing a bit of the print and ebook percentages whereas print and ebook have hit about a stasis now this is going to vary widely depending on your genre for instance books for middle grade readers sell far fewer ebook and audiobooks than print books whereas big long books tend to do better in digital formats and in audiobook formats this is because the um number one they get hard to hold um and number two because of an audible subscription method one credit buys you a book whether it's 55 hours worth of listening or nine hours worth of listening and people tend to save their credits for the very big books so the longer your book is generally that is an advantage particularly in audiobook but also to an extent in ebooks and the more tech savvy and likely to have digital devices your audience the more likely it is to move to ebook and then kind of the third thing factor here is how fast of a page turner it is so this kind of fights with the length a lot of the best page trainers are shorter books but those tend to the ones that when you finish it you immediately want the next one just really quickly want to be able to click the link and say all right i'm going to read the next one i still have a few hours left tonight before i have to go get up and go to work i'm going to read this book and so these three factors kind of push things right now with my latest book being skyward sequel um starsight star site was only 17 print okay it was 83 audiobook and digital book um in its opening weeks i haven't seen the final breakdown this was just you know the first two months um and of those audiobook it was the first book of mine that audiobook was larger than the um than the e-book numbers i believe so\n",

      " this is a big revolution and in 10 years we have gone from less than one percent digital in my royalties to only 17 print this transfer was offered a lot of opportunities to the indie published authors um and this revolution meant that the indie published authors could do a lot of the work that the big publishers were doing and did not have to deal with distribution chains warehousing and things like this and today indie publishing is almost exclusively ebook and audiobook now you will generally as an any published author have your books up for print sale but they are usually print on demand with very small royalty rates just there so that people want print copies can buy them and put them on their shelves most of the time you're not making very much money off of that print on demand because you know it costs like 19 bucks to print a copy and you sell it for 20 or something like that um probably a bit lower than that you're probably printing it for like 12 and selling at 15 or but people just aren't buying a ton of those and the the printing costs are expensive and so most of your sales will be digital indie published what happened in 2010 that really started driving this is a few authors um in particular some romance authors and some thriller authors who are writing fast-paced um what we would have once called pulp genre fiction which means it's very solidly incited genre like it's it's romance with a capital r focused on the romance that is shorter and faster paced um usually in some sort of series sometimes in romance the author's name becomes the series uh this happens um in that genre same thing in thrillers often you know dan brown thriller is a genre rather than them all being about one character but sometimes they are a lot of dan browns are for instance a lot of john grisham's or not um but either way fast-paced shorter books real page turner's priced cheaply um we're talking books for three four or five dollars that people could immediately click on the next one at the end of buying one and just says click here to buy the next one and they would just rip through these and the indie publishing market just exploded uh to the point that you can find percentages but there is a significant i i don't have these numbers offhand i didn't look them up but often it's something like 40 percent of what's being sold on on amazon is independently published which is a huge huge chunk of the market now let's point out that jk rowling is a not insignificant number of that forty percent she's like two or three percent by herself uh because she kept all the digital rights to harry potter for the audiobooks and the e-books and she self-publishes them um so\n",

      " uh as you can you can see it will run some of these numbers later if you have a small but dedicated fan base that is willing to buy whatever you sell you could theoretically let's say you published with a with a new york publisher and with them you're going to sell about 10 000 copies and on your own you're going to sell about 10 10 000 copies well that is an excellent reason to independently publish if they cannot sell you a lot more copies than you would sell if you've targeted targeted niche market you know that market really well and you're going to be selling to them then new york will do nothing for you you will make much more independently published if you also are really good at releasing things according to trends quickly writing and writing things that are good page turners and in long serial format any publishing's flexibility would allow you to do some things i would recommend you look up someone called bella forest uh bella forest is i believe the best selling in the author on amazon she might have been replaced by someone else but usually she is and bella forest model is that she releases um books that are similar to current trends in publishing she jumps on them much faster and then she releases long serialized stories about them her biggest series is the shade of vampire and this is a series that is very similar to twilight romantic urban fantasies with vampires there are something like 50 entries she releases a new one like every six weeks um and she sells tons of copies uh she is often kind of chasing at jk rowling and some of those right underneath them at like number three or four author on all of amazon uh recently i've looked and she's dropped down like number 10 or 12 or 15 but she has you know she has other things that feel a lot like hunger games she has other things that feel you know like nicholas sparks books basically and she's releasing a book every two weeks um and\n",

      " that flexibility um and that speed of publishing is just not something you can do in traditional publishing it just does not work um so one thing they wanted to point out is that you can get everything a print book it's or a trad pup um so by this i mean sorry about that terrible handwriting guys by this what they mean is if you want to get your books in bookstores you can make it happen it does happen it's harder um if you want movie deals it can happen generally harder but it can happen um for instance the emperor's soul that i released i independently published the ebook um and i went through a uh a small press a regional press called tachyon for the print book and they did a fantastic job on the print book and got it into every book store in the country and we got a movie deal offer on that that was an indie um it was a hybrid but uh i did a lot of the indie publishing for that myself um you can get they write um into the major bookstores you can get movie deals pointing out that the martian was indy published which indeed it was um you can get book signings you can get teaching speaking engagements and teaching opportunities um so those are your arguments for self-publishing and they are legit um if you watching this retain any sort of bias against vanity press or things like that because of the way the industry has talked about it you should abandon those very quickly this is a realistic and in fact um a growing uh segment of the market and it is something that you should seriously consider as a writer right now trying to break in uh so let's talk a little bit about how one breaks in to indie publishing um so\n",

      " i have generally and they talk about these things a little bit so i'll try to write up their notes a little bit later i've generally heard two general schools generally general i've heard of two general schools of thought about breaking into indie publishing um school of thought number one is this idea of becoming what is called a platform writer a platform writer which i think is mostly my term for it others might call it something else is somebody who has a really great platform that draws a lot of attention and they use that as publicity to market their novels uh larry korea is generally held up as a poster child for this larry curry if you're not familiar with him is an avid gun nut um he is um a right uh wing um commentator and things like this and loves his gun rights um issues and he broke in right before the big indie publishing thing took off by indy publishing on his own by running a blog where he talked about all his gun uh all the stuff he finds fascinating about guns and politics and then he wrote books um which accurately used it used firearms used i accurately used firearms and people who knew their way around firearms as a contrast to a lot of the media he was reading where people just didn't know what they were doing and so if you wanted to read an action adventure story with people who knew their way around guns and who presented the world in a way that larry korea's um you know fan base would really enjoy then these were perfect books for you he then had his blog to kind of funnel attention toward this he was active on a lot of gun forums and said hey you know you guys know me um i've been participating for years here i've got a good reputation here is my book maybe check it out that funneled a lot of attention toward his books and turned them into best sellers even before he got picked up by a traditional publisher which he eventually did he eventually um he picked bane which is kind of a almost it's like a traditional uh big publisher but works like a small press it's kind of an interesting case but anyway um there are still a lot of people who are platform writers um talking to a lot of indie writers recently they have said that platform writing is very hard to cut through the noise on and they recommend method number two unless you have some really good platform already or something you know really well and are good at writing blog posts and stuff and that is the publish as much as you can as quick as you can model they say that your next book is usually the best piece of marketing you can make for your previous book this stands in traditional publishing as well it is a good rule of thumb that generally making sure your next book is coming out in a timely way is more valuable to you as a marketing tool than anything else you could be doing with that time once you have that book coming out and you have extra time that's when you add on doing all the other stuff the going on the social media sites um the doing guest posts on other people's blogs people won't read blogs anymore but you know that sort of thing um all of this is secondary to making sure the next book comes out and if you're indie published that may mean your next book that you're releasing in four months it might mean the next book you're releasing in a year it depends on your publishing schedule um so\n",

      " what do you do um they recommend the following and i'm not going to write these all up because some of these are a bit longer they recommend joining joining online groups and forums like 20 books to 50k uh these groups provide a wealth of knowledge into the indie publishing world go ask people who are into polishing right now where they found their information i can't give it to you because i exist in a very different realm from this that even when i indie publish i have a platform and the platform is that i'm a well-known and reputable fantasy writer already with the marketing budget of a big five press behind me um attend conferences run specifically for indie authors or which include indie authors like story makers story makers is a local convention here to utah it is fantastic one of the best conventions i have ever attended uh point number three you must run it like a business you must be willing to put in hours and invest money we'll talk about that in a minute uh you must write a killer book or more than one before you release rapid release can be your friend it gives you more ways to market uh so what's hap what happens a lot in the publishing i've seen right now is this this blitz method um i have a good friend who sometimes has has uh taught in the class before uh jancy um and jancy has done this thing with a co-author recently that i see commonly happening in the publishing which is where they spend several years writing like 12 books in a series and then what they do is they save those all up and they release them in a blitz one a month for a year you might be saying i don't have any idea how bella forest can release a book every two weeks i don't know either no idea what's going on over there but i do know that a lot of my friends would not be capable of releasing a book a month but they can take three years and write 12 books and then blitz with a book a month for a year so that each one is building on the previous ones either way quick releases do tend to be very advantageous in indie publishing\n",

      " two main methods there is the go wide method or the amazon exclusive method so what they're meaning here is if you are willing to sign up for amazon exclusively you get a better deal um generally um they put you on kindle unlimited which is the kind of subscription service on amazon where people subscribe to it pay a monthly uh fee and then they amazon pays you based on the number of words they're read this can be really helpful for a lot of indie authors because a lot of traditional published authors are not in that so you are competing only against you know people who are in that program um but it works well for romance fantasy and mystery genres um people who are going to want to rip through an entire series sometimes going exclusively on kindle can be good for you going wide means you're putting it not just on amazon but on all the different platforms uh which can give you a wider net but a slightly worse deal and not quite as good of marketing uh from amazon amazon uh they can um so uh if you choose to go wide you can use platforms like to digital to upload your manuscript and they will distribute it to barnes noble ibooks kobo amazon etc but always upload to amazon yourself it's easy and gives you more control and more money this is what we have found as well indie publishing my books that's how we do it so on amazon your price must be 299 to 9.99 uh don't price it anything above that you can sometimes go lower than that and price your first book at 99 cents you'll get a terrible royalty because it's 30 you'll get like 35 cents a book um because you get a 35 royalty on a dollar but for a while giving away your first book for free or cheap was a method to get people reading the series readers have kind of come wise to this and it happens it's it works a little less now than it used to it used to be the kind of the silver bullet put your first book up for free than the rest series then amazon stopped liking people doing that and they stopped letting them put them up for free and would give them periods where they could be free and so people started charging at 99 cents and you would have to ask the current indie authors um what uh jennifer and becky say um be careful how you price your books and train your audience if you train them to get your ebooks for free or 99 cents from the beginning they will expect that of your future books um paperbacks um just do through their self-publishing thing until you get big enough where you may want to do a small print run of your own and sell them at conventions and things it's not a huge part but they say it's useful for getting t into particularly your local bookstores which you can do if you have enough sales and you have print books that you can give to one of the distributors to put through um they make two notes at the\n",

      " end here which i think are really smart notes uh one of them is that there are a lot of scams out there for trying to prey upon indie authors there are a ton of these and one of the best things you can do is remember that um be very skeptical of anyone asking you for money now this doesn't include obviously you're paying people for cover and for editing and things like that but be very skeptical if someone says i will do all the work for you just give me this much money a lot of those are scams not all of them but a lot of them a lot of them are vanity presses which you don't need these days because you can do this yourself the other thing they mentioned is that landscape is constantly changing and that you need to keep up to date on it and yes you do one of the big changes i've talked about this a little bit uh before in class but one of the big changes is amazon over the last couple of years has become a pay to play location wrong turn market meaning that amazon charging authors uh to advertise their books on amazon has become a major source of income for amazon and in the beginnings of the indie book revolution it was all all of amazon's recommendations were based solely on what did people who read this book also like you went to a brandon sanderson book page they would serve you ads only for books that people who bought my book then bought another book and really liked it and rated both of them highly and it didn't matter to amazon if you were indie if you were if you were traditionally published they were simply looking to sell you the best book they could to keep you reading books i think it is a mistake and short-sighted of amazon but recently they have shrunk and contracted that recommendation system and greatly expanded the an author paid to be on this page recommendation system if you go to the way of kings right now you will find the similar books that other people liked thing on there for a while they'd moved that all the way to the bottom now they moved it back up but you also find an advertisement on the page this right to the the right of my book that is paid to be there you will often find a banner ad for something that is paid to be there and then you also find sponsored books um in a big long list paid to be on this page and asking jennifer and becky they um nowadays are paying thousands of dollars a month on advertising on amazon in order to keep selling books basically this 70\n",

      " royalty looks a lot worse than it used to when you're you're having to invest 35 or 50 percent 35 you're investing 50 percent of what you make back into pay amazon to advertise your book and if you don't they just don't appear on anyone's pages you don't sell them i think this is terrible for indie publishing i think it's terrible for books in general but it is what amazon has decided to do now and they are the big player in the market they are something like 80 of all ebooks um and so if you're going to be independently published you either are going to have to have a platform that is driving people to those books pages you're going to have to somehow get popular enough that people are looking for them directly or you're gonna have to pay amazon thousands of dollars to advertise them in order to keep selling books um and this is i think very unfortunate but it is the way the world works right now double check me on that by talking to other indie authors i've asked five or ten and this is the answer they've given me but i might be getting an unrepresented a disproportionately represented um say segment of the market who is um who is paying a lot for ads and having that work and so they're continuing to do it maybe there are other ways maybe it's uh this probably this ad payment has a has a ceiling on it so once you get to a certain amount of ad spend then you make more and more so once you hit that threshold it becomes a smaller and smaller percentage of your take um but be aware that that is part of the market right now all right let's talk about um contracts uh how much time do we have left i don't have a clock in here minutes 40 minutes great\n",

      " all right we're going to talk contracts sorry again about the fire hose um let's jump over to traditional publishing because talking about contracts and your take here can kind of help you compare and contrast indie publishing right now and i'm going to switch markers because i think this one was writing better all right so in publishing a lot of the royalty rates are fairly standardized so in traditionally publishing in traditional publishing here's what you're looking at almost all books have um between 10 and 15 i said between 10 and 10. uh of cover for hardcover almost all of them have between six and eight percent of cover for paperback and all of them have around 10 of cover for um uh trade paper all right i'll explain this to you so all the the print formats are based on a cover price calculation uh these stretch back decades maybe over a century that basically whatever the publisher charges for that book they are going to pay to you a percentage of that once they get it in it does not matter what the book actually sells for so for instance usually bookstores are getting the books at around fifty percent off if they decide then that this twenty dollar book that they are going to sell for twelve dollars to put it on sale that is them deciding to make a profit of two dollars instead of ten dollars on your book they are still paying ten dollars to the publisher and out of that the publisher is still paying you ten to fifteen percent of the cover price of that initial twenty dollars as a royalty payment to you for every copy sold uh for the same thing for paperback six to eight percent same thing for trade paperback trade paperbacks are the oversized hardcover size paperbacks whereas when they say paperback we mean the pocket edition these are the u.s royalty rates uh they vary a little bit um in the uk so basically what's going on here is these you're like how do i determine if i get the 10 or the 15 almost every contract i've gotten had a break point of something like this 10 on the first 5k 12 and a half second 5k and then 15 after on the hardcover um so what this means is um if i sell 100 000 copies and you sell 100 000 copies we probably both have a very similar thing in the hardcover um thing we both make the same amount of money this is pretty nice um this is this is good to know that there isn't a lot of room here now there are rumors of people getting more uh the the most i've ever heard is that uh the rumor and i don't have this information so i could be wrong that lucasarts was getting 22 percent of hardcover on their star wars books from uh from del rey or who it was one of the random house imprints that was printing them for years um i don't know if that's true um i've never met an author personally who got higher than this without doing a drastically different deal with the publisher um there are drastically different deals where you profit share and instead take an advance you take a larger chunk of the percentage later on stephen king famously has this as rumored to have this i don't know stephen king's contracts as one of his deals and i do profit share with some of my publishers as well basically no advance higher royalties were kind of co-publishing at that point that sort of thing um but generally what you can change are in your negotiations these break points usually they don't change these percentages as much as they change the break points like for instance some of my um some of my teen books the break points were like you know first 10k or something um and then you know you shrink that same thing here like um i think my ebook started at like six percent for the first 75 or my my paperback six percent for the first 75 000 and like eight percent thereafter for some reason seven percent almost never shows up but it's one of those weird things um and trade tends to like i've seen it like you know fluctuate just by a percentage point or two but basically this is what you're getting this is a fair deal um you may say wow i only get 15 percent of that do remember that you're really making more than that because this is retail so about half is going to the retail establishment so on a a 20 book the publisher is um is getting ten dollars back and you are generally getting on that 250 so you're taking about 25 of what the publisher is making that could go higher but considering the way that they take risks up front this tends to be a fairly fair model which is why it's been negotiated over decades and has landed where it does what hasn't been negotiated for decades in fact only been negotiated for around a decade is where the ebook and audiobook royalties will end up landing and so ebook and audiobook\n",

      " are different they are calculated on net that should scare you a ton but fortunately the net is very clearly defined um and does not include costs net on ebook and audiobook is defined by what the publisher gets from the um then you selling them this is usually 25 of net where net means the 70 um of actual price that the publisher gets so what does that mean well let's say that the publisher the book is sold on amazon for ten dollars the publisher is taking getting seventy percent of that the same percentage that the indie book author is making then they are paying 25 of what they actually got to the author if this goes on sale then then your percentage shrinks it's no longer paid on cover all right so that's a very big difference this number um is starting to stabilize it is too low um a lot of industry advocates and author advocates have pointed out that this if you i'm not going to run all the numbers for you right now that this really should be somewhere around 35 percent probably or even a little higher because the publisher if you run all the the numbers which you don't have time for the publisher is making more off of each ebook sold than they make off the print book and you are making around the same they are taking a slightly higher higher percentage cut a higher net cut at the end than they need to be taking these i haven't seen this get negotiated up because a lot of authors have what are called most favored nations clauses what this means is if one author gets it negotiated up the other authors who have most favored nation clauses all should automatically get it as a matter of legal requirement in their contract so publishers have been very very resistant to change this basically to change that number you have to do some sort of profit share or something like that which requires give and takes from you but giving up advances and things like that that's been my experience your mileage may vary it could change in the future and there may be people out there who have negotiated different deals than we've been able to this is kind of where it sits in audio 25 of net though i have this one has been more negotiable i've gotten as high as around 40 percent um i've met with certain uh book publishers um this has started to stabilize back at the 25 and has been going down with the advances going up um but um that's not necessarily a bad thing because a lot of these audio contracts are for seven years and so if your exam your advance gets sky high your percentage goes down it is possible for an advance to get so high that it effectively gives you a higher royalty let's talk about that um oh there seems to be confusion in the chat between indian self-publishing they are the same we use both of those terms okay indian self-publishing are the same the only thing is different is vanity publishing which basically doesn't exist in its same form anymore and you should ignore it um indeed indian self-publishing uh words for the same thing um so you also ask about small presses i'll talk about small presses if we have time um all right so advances all right\n",

      " so remember this is all against an advance that you get up front so i'll try not to spend too much on the boring numbers here this stuff is interesting to me i know it might bore some of you but let's say on your audiobook you get paid a million dollar advance right and the audiobook publisher has looked and figured out across the seven year life of the term that you are going to under a standard royalty earn around 800k right for that 25 percent of that they've figured it out they aren't giving you a higher royalty but by offering you that one million they're basically giving you a higher royalty because they're giving you 200 000 extra and you could run the numbers and basically since that license is going to run out in seven years anyway you don't have to pay back the extra money they all ran the numbers it is possible for a book to not earn out earning out is where your royalties match the amount they gave you up front and still be successful this is how a lot of very powerful authors a lot of the politicians for example uh and celebrities get sky-high advances higher than sales would indicate their royalty should earn but because the price per copy is down so much and because um the the the book is going to sell enough copies they can effectively give the author a higher royalty rate without changing the royalty rate in the contract deciding what the right advance is for a book is a very difficult and process that involves a lot of guesswork so most of the time you want your advance to be of a size where you're going to earn that out in a couple of years um usually i look for them like do you earn this back off of the hard cover and like two years of the paperback run um if so pretty good advance that's about you know what you're looking to get sometimes it's it's viable to get higher than that only if your book is going to go to astronomical highly high sales numbers but let's just kind of look at this um number wise uh to kind of compare to indie publishing um and i did run these numbers earlier so i can write them out exactly um\n",

      " we talked about keeping a larger percentage of the cut one of the other things that indie publishing is very good at doing is undercutting the markets because they have more money to work with now slowly what's happening more money to work was the wrong term they have more uh flexibility on pricing what has happened over time is traditional publishing has pushed their prices higher and higher in the e-book market um this is because they have a different deal with amazon amazon gives them a better deal they get the 70 percent even if they go over 9.99 you don't get that deal i'm sorry amazon doesn't offer it to us to me when i indie publish they do offer it to the publishers a stormlight archive book costs 17 ebook this is not a bad thing i actually wish that ebook pricing fluctuated more based on the length of the books i have pushed my publishers to charge less for my shorter books and more for my larger books they haven't always listened to me on this but i i think it is kind of um i know it's the way the industry works but i think it's not a good way for the industry work to work that the longer the the longer books do not increase in price this pushes authors to release these very quick short books where you actually get less value for your book and i think it would be better if everyone's like you know a stormlight archive book is somewhere around eight times as long as some of these short books that are being published in a series that you are paying three dollars a piece for well eight times three would be twenty four dollars is what the stormlight archive book should cost we charge 17. uh i think that's a fair price um i know some people online are like why is this one 17 when someone else's is three well it's 400 000 word book um that said traditional publishing is not good on varying this length i wish that they would charge a lot cheaper for the hundred thousand word books and a lot more for the big books and they don't um they tend to vary like i looked up a book that is half the length of a stormlight book and it's 13 so yes it's cheaper but not significantly according to percentage this is all kind of neither here nor there if you look at the indie published authors books a lot of them will be priced 299 399 or 4.99 if we take that author whose book is 13 who's uh a pretty i'm not going to say the name but a pretty solid midlister kind of top of the midless uh fantasy novelist their their book is selling for 13 as an ebook right well if um you have your standard royalty that i talked about earlier that author is making two dollars and around 25 cents per copy that is sold by the publisher if you're indie published you can charge if your book is three dollars you are making around a two dollar profit so if your book is four dollars you're making a better profit um than the traditional published author on a book that is one-third the price this is where the power of indie authors is manifest and then being able to charge a reasonable but low price for their books undercutting the traditional published market this kind of creates this dichotomy where traditional publishing is moving more toward more expensive books that are prestige books that are by well-known authors there is a reason why someone like andy weir who self-published was very successful eventually decided to go traditionally published and you do see a lot of the people who break out the midlist going to traditional publishers because they can demand a whole bunch from them these days a lot of the mid-listing does work way better in these numbers as an indie author um that said as an indie author you have to be willing to run the business all yourself and do all these things up front one of the main reasons you would go traditionally publish instead of india published is number one you have a big enough name or enough expected sales or a book that is hitting the market at just the right time in order to demand a very large advance and to demand a lot of marketing push from the publisher another reason to go traditionally published is that doing it all yourself is just not something you want to do um this sounds like i have a good friend who's like i i know i could do all this i just don't want to that's not what i want to spend my life doing i want to she says be sending books to a publisher working with an editor letting them handle all the cover art and things like that and release the book that is a good reason to go traditionally published it is a lot of work to even traditionally publish india publishing is even more work another reason to go traditionally published would be if you want to see your book in all bookstores across the nation uh indie publishing there are very few who are able to get books in all print stores usually you can get them regionally to your local stores but getting them into bookstores all around the country and all around the world uh very hard to do as an any published author um not impossible but very hard to do and if you want to be able to walk into a bookstore and find your book on the shelf and you probably want to be traditionally published then another reason to be traditionally published is if you are writing in a genre that does not lend itself well to the things that are selling well in indie books uh i often use um a book like the doomsday book um as an example of this uh connie willis it's a fantastic science fiction writer who does a ton of research for her books and writes basically time travel books with exhaustively researched historical periods where people from a future society go back to a historical period these books are long they're in depth she only releases one every four or five years if that often and they win a lot of awards and um they deserve them she would be poorly placed in the indie publishing market because she releases books so infrequently that she needs the doesn't need it but it's better to have the publisher pushing the book to get a wider pickup by libraries and schools and to win awards and to have that drive the sales between you know the five years that she's releasing a new book that's an author who's served much better by traditionally pub being traditionally published uh 20 minutes great um so let's break and talk briefly about marketing and self-promotion and then maybe get to a few of these questions which are popping up on the screen that i can no longer see so that is good all right so let's get to the last part of what uh becky and uh jennifer um\n",

       "\" this is a big revolution and in 10 years we have gone from less than one percent digital in my royalties to only 17 print this transfer was offered a lot of opportunities to the indie published authors um and this revolution meant that the indie published authors could do a lot of the work that the big publishers were doing and did not have to deal with distribution chains warehousing and things like this and today indie publishing is almost exclusively ebook and audiobook now you will generally as an any published author have your books up for print sale but they are usually print on demand with very small royalty rates just there so that people want print copies can buy them and put them on their shelves most of the time you're not making very much money off of that print on demand because you know it costs like 19 bucks to print a copy and you sell it for 20 or something like that um probably a bit lower than that you're probably printing it for like 12 and selling at 15 or but people just aren't buying a ton of those and the the printing costs are expensive and so most of your sales will be digital indie published what happened in 2010 that really started driving this is a few authors um in particular some romance authors and some thriller authors who are writing fast-paced um what we would have once called pulp genre fiction which means it's very solidly incited genre like it's it's romance with a capital r focused on the romance that is shorter and faster paced um usually in some sort of series sometimes in romance the author's name becomes the series uh this happens um in that genre same thing in thrillers often you know dan brown thriller is a genre rather than them all being about one character but sometimes they are a lot of dan browns are for instance a lot of john grisham's or not um but either way fast-paced shorter books real page turner's priced cheaply um we're talking books for three four or five dollars that people could immediately click on the next one at the end of buying one and just says click here to buy the next one and they would just rip through these and the indie publishing market just exploded uh to the point that you can find percentages but there is a significant i i don't have these numbers offhand i didn't look them up but often it's something like 40 percent of what's being sold on on amazon is independently published which is a huge huge chunk of the market now let's point out that jk rowling is a not insignificant number of that forty percent she's like two or three percent by herself uh because she kept all the digital rights to harry potter for the audiobooks and the e-books and she self-publishes them um so\""

      " who has started what we call or is running what we call an imprint back in the day 6070 years ago these were all independent publishers they would start up a business usually named after themselves and they would be acquiring books and publishing these days almost all of these are owned by 5 the big five publishers though there are some very large book companies that are not part of that for instance scholastic is not part of the Big Five and they are very large publisher but generally everything is under a big one the big publishers and a lot of these imprints are mini little shall we say cities in the publishing Empire so in a big company like McMillan which is one of my publishers there is an imprint called tor books which was founded by Tom Doherty back in the late 70s early 80s was run as a separate independent publisher for a while and then acquired by Macmillan in the 90s Tom Doherty is still the publisher of that imprint at tor a publisher is primarily a business person and they have several people underneath them that you probably should know about they have what's called an editorial director they have editors and they have acquisitions editors and there's also sometimes VPS or you know assistant publishers different types of names so what is this doing basically your publishers job is to handle the business side of things and the editors job is to handle editorial the editors job is to acquire books for the publisher to publish now what you should understand is that these roles are often held by not held by separate individuals depending on the company for instance at tour for many years Tom Doherty was also the editorial director Harriet mcdougal was the editorial director at first she retired it became Robert Jordans editor only and his wife and Tom Doherty basically became the editorial director an editorial directors job is to oversee the editors to make sure that they are doing their jobs basically middle management in charge of editors an editor's job is to work with an author in ways we'll explain later to take the book to make it better to perfect it and kind of be basically a project manager sorry barely read that editors kind of like a project manager their job is to oversee each project which is a book and an acquisitions editor is somebody who reads through what we call the slush pile slush pile is all of the submissions that have been sent in to the publisher the people who want their books to be published and the acquisitions editor reads to them and finds books that they want to publish now at tour for example and a lot of companies these are not two separate jobs much of the time indeed a lot of times the editor is the acquisitions editor or the editor has an assistant whose job is to help them with all of their work and will also act as a partial acquisitions editor for them and that the assistant will not be acquiring themselves they'll just be looking for promising manuscripts to give to the editor that the editor might want to my editor at tor Moshe fader was the assistant to another editor for many years helped him with acquiring books and with editing them and then eventually was told you are allowed to now acquire for yourself and then motion went out and started to look for authors to acquire for himself and moved up into being an editor so this is just useful to know about the publishers you're submitting to to know which imprint has who is their publisher at Random House which publishes my team books we have a basically editorial director slash publisher all wrapped up in one who is not the head publisher but is in charge of a small group of editors her name is Beverly and she doesn't acquire she just manages these editors normally the people in this position are going to do much less acquisitions in fact they may not do any once in a blue moon a friend of Tom's would want to publish a book and Tom would would read it himself and be like you know what I really like this if it's tour he would then assign it to one of his editors and say you become the editor on this project I don't believe that Beverly over it at Random House Delacorte is the imprint there that I published with does any acquisition herself she just oversees everyone else once in a while an editorial director will have their own line of books they're publishing while they're overseeing everyone else and that fact that was the case with Harriet at tour before she retired from that position so it's useful to know because this will influence who you're sending your books to who you are targeting and who you want to buy them for instance at tour approaching Tom Doherty directly is probably not going to work for you like I said once in a while one of his friends or someone he knows or some some contact you will make him say you know what I'm gonna acquire this book but most of the time at tour you're gonna be looking for directly at the editors and trying to pitch your books to them how do you do that well this takes us into kind of Phase two this over here we'll talk about how books get to these people and they come through to general format our avenues one is agents and one is direct over the years that was a really weird way to write direct print over the years publishing has moved less direct and more agented this has been a continual trend that began decades ago and is still a continuing trend that more and more publishers are saying on their submission guidelines that they do not take on agented submissions the big shift in this as I understand happened really in the 80s and 90s where agents started to shoulder more of the burden of reading slush and picking out the gems and sending those directly to the editors this is how most books I would say these days are sold traditionally is that an author picks up an agent the agent then takes it to all the editors in town pitches the book to them picks and gets offers back goes back to the author and says here's our offers what do you want to do in these sorts of things direct still happens I sold direct I sold a Elantra to tour books in 2003 through a submission directly to an editor that I had met at a convention that was Moshe instead of having an agent I was submitting to agents at the same time but I sold directly now one of the questions that arises a lot regarding this is should I be hunting an agent should I be going direct as I said direct is actually getting harder and harder to do most agents will say to you and most editors probably as well will say your best bet is the hunt an agent first don't submit the book to editors directly the reason they say this is because if an agent picks up a book then finds out you've actually submitted it to every editor already and they've rejected it that agent will feel like this book has already gone through the town and is therefore soiled good I don't know it's like they can't sell this book that's the fear that they have I will tell you a contrasting opinion of that I think that that opinion is wise and valid there is an argument for\n"
