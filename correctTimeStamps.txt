We Will Get to as the Class Progresses So First Question Ask What Flaws Do You Have that Make You a Better Writer It's a Very Good Question I'Ll Try Not To Be Insulted It's Actually an Excellent Question because Looking at this Sort of Thing Does Really Help Kind Of Understand Flaws and Limitations and Things like that I Think Naturally as a Writer One of My Greatest Strengths Was Also One of My Greatest Flaws Which Is Often the Way It Is in Fact if You Can Write Your Characters that Way It Is Usually a Good Idea Right and for Me this Was My Ability To Write Fast and My Eagerness To Work on New Projects

93
I'M Okay with Them Adding that Even though They Didn't Set It Up Ahead of Time and the Way that Sanderson's First Law Kind Of Says They Should because the Whole Genre Has some Laws with It if a Person Who Is a Vampire Drinks Someone's Blood and Gets Their Energy Back at the End of a Book Where They'Ve Never Done that before Most Readers GonNa Be like Oh Yeah that's What Vampires Do Right and so that's another Way To Kind Of Have a Magic System That You Are Playing off of but It Doesn't Feel like Magic Is if It's Playing into the Genre Conventions
